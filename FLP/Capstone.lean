# The ⅓-spread theorem (FLP95, Theorem 1.4 — milestone M3)

The capstone.  For coprime `p > q ≥ 2` and **every** real `ξ > 0`, the fractional parts
`{ξ(p/q)ⁿ}` have range spread at least `1/p`:

> `1/p ≤ limsup {ξ(p/q)ⁿ} − liminf {ξ(p/q)ⁿ}`.

The `p/q = 3/2` case (`three_halves_spread`) is **milestone M3** of the `(3/2)ⁿ` equidistribution
ladder (report2-weyl §5): the orbit of `ξ(3/2)ⁿ` never gets trapped in an interval shorter than `1/3`.

## Proof (`plan-FLT.html` §4.3)

Suppose the spread were `< 1/p`.  Then, choosing `ε` small, the orbit is eventually trapped in an
interval `[s', L+ε)` of width `< 1/p` (from `eventually_lt_of_limsup_lt` /
`eventually_lt_of_lt_liminf`).  Shifting `ξ` to `ξ' = ξ(p/q)^K` traps the *whole* forward orbit, so
`ξ'` is a `Z`-number for a window of width `< 1/p`.  But the parameters with an empty `Z`-set are
dense (`FLP.ParamDensity.ZSet_empty_dense`) and include `s = 0` (`ZSet_empty_zero`), so there is an
`s*` with `[s', L+ε) ⊆ [s*, s*+1/p)` and `Z_{p/q}(s*, s*+1/p) = ∅` — yet `ξ' ∈ Z_{p/q}(s*, s*+1/p)`.
Contradiction.

`q ≥ 2` is essential: for integer `β = p` (i.e. `q = 1`), `ξ = 1/(p-1)` has `{ξpⁿ}` constant, spread
`0`.  The formal statement is the `Int.fract` version (not the centered/circle-arc variant, which is
genuinely not a corollary of FLP's interval machinery).
