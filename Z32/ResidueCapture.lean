# Residue non-capture: `⌊ξ(3/2)ⁿ⌋ mod m` is never eventually constant (plan-cert32 T1, M1)

> **T1.** For every real `ξ > 0` and every modulus `m ≥ 3`, the sequence of residues
> `⌊ξ(3/2)ⁿ⌋ mod m` is **not** eventually constant.

Three ingredients, all already in place:

1. the **dictionary** (`Z32/Dictionary.lean`): `⌊t⌋ ≡ r (mod m)` iff `{t/m} ∈ [r/m, (r+1)/m)`, so
   eventual residue capture at `r` says the orbit of `η = ξ/m` is eventually confined to a cell of
   length `1/m ≤ 1/3`;
2. the **shift trick** (`Z32.mem_ZSet_of_eventually`): eventual confinement of `η` from step `N` is
   genuine confinement of `η(3/2)^N`, i.e. an element of `FLP.ZSet`;
3. the **five escape certificates** (`Z32/EscapeCert.lean`): `Z_{3/2}(s, s+⅓) = ∅` at
   `s ∈ {0, ⅙, ⅓, ½, ⅔}`.

The only genuinely new step is combinatorial: those five windows, of length `⅓` at spacing `⅙`,
**cover every cell** `[r/m, (r+1)/m)` with `m ≥ 3` (`Z32.exists_grid_window`: locate `6r` among the
multiples of `m`, with `m = 3, 4` checked cell by cell).  For `m = 3` the slack is zero and the cell
*is* the window (`r/3 ↦ s = r/3`); for `m ≥ 4` there is room to dodge.  Hence `Z32.ZSet_cell_empty`: no `ξ > 0` keeps `{ξ(3/2)ⁿ}` inside a cell of any
modulus `m ≥ 3`, and T1 follows.

## Claim level (gates G-5, G-6 of `plans/plan-cert32.html`)

T1 is stated nowhere in the twenty-eight papers read across the plan's six literature gates, but it
is **not** new mathematics: it is a one-line corollary of [Dub09AA] Theorem 1, which gives
`Z_{3/2}(s, s+⅓) = ∅` for *every* `s` — a strictly stronger input than the five positions used
here.  Claim level, fixed at G-5: **folklore-grade corollary, formalization-only.**  What is new is
the proof object: kernel-checked, `std3`-only, zero cited axioms, no `native_decide`.

`m = 2` is deliberately excluded and is not an oversight: the two cells `[0,½)` and `[½,1)` are
Mahler's `Z`-number problem and its parity twin (plan-cert32 §1.3, T8), both open.

/-! ## The covering combinatorics

The five certified windows are `[k/6, k/6 + 1/3)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4`.  A cell
`[r/m, (r+1)/m)` fits into the window of index `k` exactly when `k·m ≤ 6r` (left endpoint) and
`6r + 6 ≤ (k+2)·m` (right endpoint).  Choosing `k` by the position of `6r` among the multiples of
`m` works for every `m ≥ 3`. -/

/-- **The covering lemma.**  For every modulus `m ≥ 3` and residue `r < m` there is a grid window
index `k ≤ 4` with `[r/m, (r+1)/m) ⊆ [k/6, k/6 + 1/3)`, stated as the two integer inequalities.

The tight cases are `m = 3` (equality on both sides — the cell *is* the window) and `m = 4` at
`r = 1, 3` (equality on the right). -/
