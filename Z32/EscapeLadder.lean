# The escape ladder: which arcs `{ξ(p/q)ⁿ}` must visit (plan-M5A9, milestone N1)

`plans/plan-M5A9.html` §5 asks for the *ladder* below milestone M5 — "the orbit `{(3/2)ⁿ}` is dense
in `[0,1]`" — as a formal predicate family, together with every rung the corpus can already reach.
This file is that ladder.  Everything in it is a **complement** of the confinement statements of
`Z32/SmallInterval.lean` and `Z32/BlockCert.lean`: an orbit that cannot stay inside a set must
leave it infinitely often, which is a visit to the complementary arc.

## The predicate family

* `Z32.inArc s t x` — `x` lies, modulo one, in the half-open arc of length `t` starting at `s`.
  It is `Int.fract (x - s) < t`, so the arc **wraps around `0` by itself** and `s` may be any real
  number: no endpoint case split anywhere below.  This is exactly the shape [Dub09AA] Theorem 1 is
  stated in (`Z32.dubickas_theorem_1`), which is why the uniform rung is a two-line corollary.
* `Z32.VisitsIO β ξ s t` — the orbit `n ↦ ξβⁿ` meets that arc for infinitely many `n`.
* `Z32.M5 β t` — the rung: *every* arc of length `t` is visited infinitely often by the orbit of
  *every* `ξ ≠ 0`.  `M5(t)` for all `t > 0` is density for all `ξ ≠ 0`; milestone M5 itself is the
  single instance `ξ = 1`, `β = 3/2`.

## The rungs

| rung | statement | source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| uniform, `1 - 1/p` | `Z32.M5_one_sub_inv` | `Z32.dubickas_theorem_1` (`p < q²`, all `s`) |
| uniform, `2/3` at `3/2` | `Z32.M5_two_thirds` | idem at `(3,2)` |
| uniform, `2/3`, *open* arcs | `Z32.visits_open_arc_two_thirds` | idem, complement is closed of length `1/p` |
| uniform, `3/4` at `4/3` | `Z32.M5_four_three_three_quarters` | idem at `(4,3)` |
| positional, `5/8` | `Z32.visits_arc_five_eighths` | `Z32.not_eventually_mem_sixth_3_8` |
| positional, `0.59278` | `Z32.visits_arc_frontier` | `Z32.BlockCert.certFrontier` |
| positional, `17/24` at `4/3` | `Z32.visits_arc_four_three` | `Z32.BlockCert.certFourThree` |
| positional, `4/5` at `5/2` | `Z32.visits_arc_five_two` | `Z32.BlockCert.certFiveTwo` |
| union, `19/39` (closed) | `Z32.visits_compl_dub08` | `Z32.BlockCert.certDub08` |
| union, `5/12` | `Z32.visits_compl_union_seven_twelfths` | `Z32.BlockCert.certUnion712` |
| union, `1/3` | `Z32.visits_compl_union_two_thirds` | `Z32.BlockCert.certUnion23` |
| union, `11/36` | `Z32.visits_compl_union_record` | `Z32.BlockCert.certUnion2536` |
| M2, infinitely many limit points | `Z32.limitSet_infinite` | `Z32.M5_two_thirds` |

The four *positional* rungs are the sharp ones: they beat the uniform `2/3` at the positions where
the atlas of `plans/plan-cert32.html` §4.4 certifies a window, and `0.59278` is the best any
certificate of this family will ever give at `3/2` (experiment X2: nothing certifies at any
position once the window exceeds `1467/3600`).  The union rungs are *not* arcs — an orbit's
complement of a union of windows is a union of gaps — so they are stated as membership in the
explicit complement.

## Limit sets

`Z32.limitSet β ξ` is the set of subsequential limits of `n ↦ {ξβⁿ}`.  Frequent visits to a compact
set put a limit point in it (`Z32.mem_limitSet_of_frequently`), which upgrades two rungs:

* `Z32.limitSet_meets_arc_five_eighths` — every orbit has a limit point in
  `[0,1/6] ∪ [13/24,1]`;
* `Z32.limitSet_meets_union_record_compl` — every orbit has a limit point in a closed set of total
  length `11/36 = 0.3055…`, the complement of the `25/36` record entry.  Compare the best explicit
  statement in print, [Dub08] Corollary 1.2, whose complement has length `19/39 = 0.4871…`
  (`Z32.visits_compl_dub08`).

The last section proves the **M2 rung** of the ladder, `Z32.limitSet_infinite`: for every `ξ ≠ 0`
the orbit has *infinitely many* limit points ([Vij40] 1940).  It is a corollary of the uniform rung
`Z32.M5_two_thirds` — see the section header for why the textbook shadowing route is not available
here — and it is the one rung of `plans/plan-M5A9.html` Figure 2 below M5 that the corpus did not
already have.

## What is *not* here

The uniform ladder stops at `2/3`, and not for want of trying: the engine sweep behind the atlas
(plan-cert32 milestone M2 — a different M2 from the rung above — experiment X2 of §4.4) certifies
`100%` of positions at length `1/3`, `79.2%` one grid step above it, and nothing at all from
`0.4083` on, so no engine of this family will produce a uniform rung below `2/3`.  The next rung
down is a different theorem, not a better certificate.

## Trust ledger

`std3` (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`) throughout: no cited axiom, no `sorry`, no
`native_decide`.  The two analytic inputs are `Z32.dubickas_theorem_1` ([Dub09AA] Theorem 1, proved
in `Z32/SmallInterval.lean` by the Sturmian route) and `Z32.BlockCert.Cert.not_confined` (the
kernel-checked block certificates), both themselves axiom-free.

## Claim level

Formalization only.  The uniform rung is Dubickas's 2009 theorem read through its complement; the
positional and union rungs are complements of entries already shipped at plan-cert32 milestones
M2/M3/M6; the M2 rung is Vijayaraghavan's 1940 theorem.  Nothing here is claimed as new
mathematics; what is new is that the ladder is machine-checked and stated in one predicate family,
and that the M2 rung is derived from the uniform rung rather than from shadowing.

The two bridges the whole file runs on.  The first reads an escape *from a closed arc* — the shape
of [Dub09AA] Theorem 1 — as a visit to the complementary half-open arc.  The second does the same

/-! ## The M2 rung: infinitely many limit points

[Vij40] proves that `{ξ(3/2)ⁿ}` has infinitely many limit points for every `ξ > 0`.  It is the one
rung of the ladder of `plans/plan-M5A9.html` §4 below M5 that the corpus did not have, and
`plans/plan-M5A9.html` §5 lists it as N1's stretch item together with a warning: the textbook route
(a finite limit set is shadowed by a periodic orbit, whose carry word contradicts
`Z32.not_isEventuallyPeriodic_carry`) needs a shadowing step that is **false as stated** here.  The
reason is correction C1 of that plan: the `ξ`-dynamics is a *two-branch relation*, not the Lorenz
map `y ↦ {3y/2}` — `y_{n+1}` depends on the parity of `⌊ξ(3/2)ⁿ⌋` as well as on `yₙ` — so a point
of a finite limit set has **two** admissible successors, differing by exactly `1/2`, and an
itinerary through a finite graph of out-degree two need not be eventually periodic.

The route below avoids shadowing altogether and uses only the ladder:

1. every limit point `a` has a limit point `b` with `3a - 2b ∈ ℤ` (the carry identity survives to
   the limit because `ℤ` is closed) — `Z32.exists_succ_mem_limitSet`;
2. iterate: in a *finite* limit set the chain repeats, and the two congruences
   `2ᵐb ≡ 3ᵐa`, `2ⁿb ≡ 3ⁿa (mod 1)` force `(3ⁿ2ᵐ - 3ᵐ2ⁿ)·b ∈ ℤ`, so every limit point is rational
   with an explicit denominator — `Z32.exists_den_of_finite_limitSet`;
3. one denominator `D` serves all of them, so the orbit of `Dξ` is eventually within `1/6` of `ℤ`
   — an arc of length `1/3`;
4. `Z32.M5_two_thirds` says the complementary arc of length `2/3` is visited infinitely often.
   Contradiction.

So the M2 rung is a *corollary of the uniform rung* rather than of the aperiodicity lemma, and it
needs nothing about `ξ = 1`. -/

/-- **The M2 rung ([Vij40]).**  For every `ξ ≠ 0` the orbit `{ξ(3/2)ⁿ}` has infinitely many limit
points.

Proved here from `Z32.M5_two_thirds` alone: a finite limit set would be rational with a common
denominator `D` (`Z32.exists_den_of_finite_limitSet`), the orbit of `Dξ` would then be eventually
inside an arc of length `1/3` around `0`, and the uniform rung visits its complement — an arc of
length `2/3` — infinitely often.

Claim level: formalization only.  This is Vijayaraghavan's 1940 theorem; only the proof route is
new, and it is new because the textbook one does not survive contact with the two-branch carry
relation (`plans/plan-M5A9.html` correction C1). -/
