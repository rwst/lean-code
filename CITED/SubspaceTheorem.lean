# The Subspace Theorem (Schmidt / Evertse–Schlickewei), cited

The `S`-arithmetic **Subspace Theorem** — Schmidt's Theorem 1D′ in the
Evertse–Schlickewei number-field form — recorded here as *one* canonical cited
`axiom`, the single deepest Diophantine engine behind the `(3/2)ⁿ` complexity
program.  It is the black box that both formerly-bespoke axioms of the
program bottomed out at — **both derivations are now complete (2026-07-14)**:

* the [CZ04] Main Theorem is this theorem at `n = 2` with a *fixed* linear
  form — i.e. **Ridout's theorem** — applied once; derived as
  `CZ.pseudoPisot_approx_of_subspace` (`CITED/CorvajaZannierProof.lean`,
  sorry-free), the bespoke axiom retired.
* the repaired [NKR25] Theorem 1.3(i) is this theorem at `n = 3` over `ℚ`;
  derived as `NKR.sUnit_pair_integrality_of_subspace`
  (`CITED/NairKumarRoutProof.lean`, sorry-free).  The *unrepaired* axiom was
  **provably false** (missing strict positivity — machine-checked refutation
  `NKR.thm13i_unrepaired_false` in `CITED/NairKumarRout.lean`); the axiom is
  deleted, not merely derived (`report-formalize-subspace.html` §4, §6).

Recording it once, and deriving those two consequences in Lean, collapses the
program's Mahler-problem / `S`-unit Diophantine backbone to a single famous
axiom (Ridout is itself a corollary of the Subspace Theorem, so the whole
`Roth → Ridout → Subspace` tower reduces to this one statement).  The
one-axiom end state is reached: `TH.complexity_superlinear` depends on
std3 + `Subspace.evertseSchlickewei` only.

## The theorem

> Let `K` be a number field, `n ≥ 2`, and `S` a finite set of places of `K`
> containing the archimedean ones.  For each `v ∈ S` let `L_{v,1}, …, L_{v,n}`
> be `n` linearly independent linear forms in `X_1, …, X_n` with coefficients in
> `K`.  For every `ε > 0`, the nonzero solutions `x ∈ Kⁿ` of
> $$ \prod_{v \in S} \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{|L_{v,i}(x)|_v}{\lVert x\rVert_v}
>     \ \le\ H(x)^{-n-\varepsilon} $$
> lie in **finitely many proper linear subspaces** of `Kⁿ`.

Here `‖x‖_v = maxᵢ |x_i|_v` is the local sup-norm and `H(x) = ∏_v ‖x‖_v` the
absolute (projective) multiplicative height — exactly Mathlib's
`Height.mulHeight`, whose definition uses the *same* local norm `⨆ i, v (x i)`
over the admissible family `Height.AdmissibleAbsValues`.

## Encoding conventions (and safe weakenings)

Recorded on the authority of [S] / [BG06]; a faithful transcription, with the
following documented choices (each of which a consumer may only *weaken*):

* **Field**: stated for a general `[NumberField K]`.  Every consumer specializes
  `K := ℚ` (degree 1); the ready-made `Subspace.evertseSchlickewei_rat` is that
  instantiation.
* **Places**: `S : Finset (AbsoluteValue K ℝ)`.  In use `S` is a finite set of
  the admissible places (the members of `Height.AdmissibleAbsValues.archAbsVal`
  and `.nonarchAbsVal`) containing all archimedean ones — e.g. `{∞, 2, 3}` over
  `ℚ`.  As with the sibling cited axioms this membership is documented, not
  enforced structurally.
* **Forms**: `L v : Fin n → ((Fin n → K) →ₗ[K] K)`, `K`-linear forms with
  coefficients in `K`, required linearly independent per place (`hL`).  For the
  `ℚ`-consumers the forms have *rational* coefficients (e.g. `x₀ − δ·x₁` with
  `δ ∈ ℚ`, and coordinate forms), a special case of the general statement.
* **Norm / threshold**: the local norm is `⨆ i, v (x i)` (Mathlib's), the
  double product is `Subspace.approxProduct`, and `H(x)^{-n-ε}` lives in `ℝ` via
  `rpow` with `ε : ℝ` free.  Matches [NKR25] Theorem 2.1 verbatim.
* **Conclusion**: `∃ T : Finset (Submodule K (Fin n → K))`, all members proper
  (`W ≠ ⊤`), covering every solution.  The finiteness is **ineffective**
  (Subspace-based): no bound on the number or the height of the subspaces.

## Contents

* `Subspace.localNorm` — the local sup-norm `‖x‖_v = ⨆ i |x_i|_v`.
* `Subspace.approxProduct` — the double product `∏_{v∈S} ∏_i |L_{v,i}(x)|_v/‖x‖_v`.
* `Subspace.evertseSchlickewei` — **the Subspace Theorem** ([S] Thm 1D′), a cited
  `axiom`; finitely many proper subspaces contain all solutions.
* `Subspace.evertseSchlickewei_rat` — the `K := ℚ` specialization consumers use.
