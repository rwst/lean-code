# Balance vectors: the finite-resolution form of the M6 enemy (plan-A6+, WP1)

`plans/plan-A6+.html` C6 asks for the two-front architecture in a form Lean can hold *today*:
instead of weak-\* limits of empirical measures on the solenoid (risk R-G, unsurveyed at the time),
work at finite resolution with **level-`w` frequency vectors** and the **flow-conservation
equations** of the level-`w` carry graph.  This file is that layer.  See "The measure formulation"
below for the current status of that deferral — the gap has since half closed, and it does not
change what is proved here.

## The objects

* `Z32.edgeOk w b b'` — the **level-`w` carry graph**.  At `ξ = 1` consecutive orbit points obey
  `2x_{n+1} = 3xₙ - sₙ` with an integer carry `sₙ ∈ {-1,0,1,2}` (`Z32.exists_carry`); the edge test
  asks whether *some* point of the window `b` is carried into the window `b'` by one branch.  After
  scaling by `2ʷ` this is an intersection of two integer intervals, so `edgeOk` is a `Bool` the
  kernel evaluates (`Z32.edgeOk_complete_two`).
* `Z32.freqVec`, `Z32.flowVec` — the empirical frequency vector `A_N(w,b)/N` and the empirical edge
  flow `#{n < N : cellₙ = b, cell_{n+1} = b'}/N`.
* `Z32.BalanceVec w` — a **balance vector**: a probability vector `μ` on the level-`w` cells and a
  nonnegative flow `ν` on the edges with `Σ_{b'} ν(b,b') = μ(b) = Σ_{b'} ν(b',b)` (conservation)
  and `ν` supported on the graph.  Pure finite linear algebra: no measure theory anywhere.

## The results

* `Z32.exists_balanceVec` — **the balance lemma**.  Along any sequence of horizons `N k → ∞` the
  empirical flow vectors have a limit point, and every limit point *is* a balance vector whose mass
  vector is the limit of the empirical frequency vectors.  (Bolzano–Weierstrass on `[0,1]^{E}`; the
  out-marginal is exact, the in-marginal costs the two boundary dates, `≤ 1/N`.)
* `Z32.exists_balanceVec_zero_of_not_V4` — **the enemy statement (C6)**.  If the window `(w,b)`
  fails M6 — no positive lower density — then the level-`w` carry graph carries a stationary vector
  with **zero mass at `b`**.  Its support is a `Z32.IsTrap`: a nonempty set of cells closed under
  taking some successor and some predecessor, i.e. a subgraph carrying a cycle that avoids `b`.
* `Z32.V4_of_forall_trap_mem` — the criterion in contrapositive form: if *every* trap of the
  level-`w` graph contains `b`, then the window `(w,b)` has positive lower density.
* `Z32.exists_trap_not_mem` — and the criterion's hypothesis is never satisfiable (`w ≥ 2`).
* `Z32.exists_balanceVec_zero` — **and the criterion is vacuous at every level.**  For every
  `w ≥ 2` and every window `b` there is a balance vector with zero mass at `b`: the fixed point `0`
  gives a self-loop at the cell of `0`, and the rational 2-cycle `{2/5, 3/5}` (denominator
  `5 = 3² - 2²`, the [L90] shape) gives a cycle avoiding it.  So no level-`w` balance argument can
  prove M6 at any window, at any resolution — the flow layer alone never excludes the *atomic*
  (cycle) enemies.  This is C6's "the stationary vectors supported on proper subgraphs are exactly
  the cycle enemies", proved rather than asserted, and it is why Front D of the plan is Diophantine
  and not dynamical.
* `Z32.cycle_point_eq`, `Z32.dist_cycle_point` — **the cycle-point classification** promised by
  WP1: a `p`-periodic point of the carry relation is `A/(3^p - 2^p)` with `3^p - 2^p` **odd** (the
  [L90] rational-cycle shape), so `Z32.dist_odd_denom` applies to it and the `ξ = 1` orbit stays
  `≥ 1/((3^p-2^p)2ⁿ)` away from every `p`-cycle — the quantitative floor C7/WP2 runs on.

## The measure formulation (status of risk R-G; hygiene item H3, 2026-08-01)

The deferral above was recorded as risk R-G — "the weak-\* machinery is unsurveyed, attacking WP1
through `ProbabilityMeasure` sinks it".  **Its compactness half has closed upstream.**
`Mathlib.MeasureTheory.Measure.Prokhorov` now supplies
`instCompactSpaceProbabilityMeasure : CompactSpace E → CompactSpace (ProbabilityMeasure E)` together
with the tightness variants (`isCompact_closure_of_isTightMeasureSet` and friends), and
`Measure.Tight`, `Measure.LevyProkhorovMetric`, `Measure.Portmanteau` sit beside it — so limit
measures of empirical measures on a compact metrizable solenoid exist by *instance search*, not by
hand.  The measure-theoretic form of this file is therefore **scheduled rather than blocked**:
`TH/Solenoid/LimitMeasures.lean` (`plans/plan-A1+.html` L4–L5, work package W4) is where
`empirical`, `limitMeasures`, invariance under the doubling map, and `u.d. ⟺ {Haar}` go, on
`Σ₆ = (ℝ × ℚ₂ × ℚ₃)/ℤ[1/6]`.  What is still genuinely absent (probe `plan-A1+` §3.3, re-checked
2026-08-01) is the *solenoid type* itself — none upstream, none repo-wide — and **measure-theoretic
(Kolmogorov–Sinai) entropy**, which `ForMathlib` must supply; Mathlib has only
`Dynamics.TopologicalEntropy`.

**None of this weakens the theorems below, and the vacuity result is not an artifact of finite
resolution.**  `exists_balanceVec_zero` holds at *every* level `w ≥ 2`, and its two witnesses are
genuine points of the orbit closure — the fixed point `0` and the rational 2-cycle `{2/5, 3/5}` —
whose Dirac and cycle-averaged measures are invariant measures upstairs as well.  A solenoid version
inherits exactly the same atomic enemies.  Passing to measures buys resolution, not the missing
hypothesis: that stays Front D (Diophantine, atomic exclusion), which is C6's point and claim-ledger
entry L-24.

## Trust ledger

`std3` (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`): no cited axiom, no `sorry`, no
`native_decide`.

## Claim level

Formalization only.  Flow conservation for empirical vectors is standard (it is the finite form of
"empirical limits are invariant"); the cycle-denominator computation is [L90] arithmetic.  What is
new here is only the *bookkeeping*: the level-`w` carry graph as a kernel-checkable `Bool`, and the
vacuity theorem `Z32.exists_balanceVec_zero`, which records once and for all what this layer cannot
do (L-23 discipline: the objects are new, the mathematics is not).

/-! ## The level-`w` carry graph

An edge `b → b'` records that *some* point of the window `b` is carried into the window `b'`.  This
is weaker than any invariance statement — deliberately so: it is the largest graph the orbit is
guaranteed to walk in, and the whole point of the vacuity theorem below is that this is too weak to
exclude cycles.  Scaled by `2ʷ`, the branch-`s` condition is the meeting of `[3b, 3b+3) - s·2ʷ`
with `[2b', 2b'+2)`, an integer test. -/

The finite-resolution replacement for a `×3/2`-invariant limit measure (C6).  Everything is a
finite sum of reals: `μ` is a probability vector on the `2ʷ` cells, `ν` a nonnegative flow on the
edges, and the two marginals of `ν` are both `μ` — flow conservation.  The last field is the only
place the dynamics enters: the flow lives on the level-`w` carry graph. -/

`isCompact_univ_pi` and nothing measure-theoretic is involved.  The out-marginal identity is exact,

two boundary dates, i.e. `1/N`, which vanishes. -/

/-! ### The worked `w = 2` instance

At level `2` the carry graph is **complete**: all sixteen ordered pairs of cells are edges, so every
singleton is a trap and the obstruction sees nothing whatsoever at this resolution.  Kernel-checked
by `decide`.  (The graph does become sparse higher up — at level `w` each cell has at most the four
carries as out-edges, so `4·2ʷ` of the `4ʷ` pairs — but `Z32.exists_trap_not_mem` shows the
sparsity never helps.) -/

/-! ## Cycle points and the [L90] denominator

A `p`-periodic point of the carry relation is rational with **odd** denominator `3^p - 2^p` — the
[L90] rational-cycle shape.  Combined with the 2-adic floor `Z32.dist_odd_denom` this is the
quantitative separation the sojourn dichotomy (C7, WP2) runs on.

C6 quotes the denominator shape as `(3^p - 2^p)·2^j`; the `2^j` is the solenoid fibre direction and
is invisible at finite resolution.  What a `p`-cycle of the carry relation contributes on the
circle is the **odd** factor alone, and that is exactly the factor the 2-adic floor consumes: the
orbit point `xₙ` has denominator `2ⁿ` and numerator odd, so it cannot sit closer than
`1/((3^p-2^p)2ⁿ)` to any of these rationals. -/
