# Bernstein–Lagarias — the metric conjugacy: `Φ` preserves Haar measure (BL96, §1)

Daniel J. Bernstein and Jeffrey C. Lagarias, *The 3x+1 conjugacy map*, Canadian Journal of
Mathematics **48** (1996), no. 6, 1154–1169.

This file upgrades the topological conjugacy `(1.3)` to a **metric** one: the explicit 3x+1 conjugacy
map `Φ` (`BL.ConjugacyMap.Φ`) is **measure-preserving** for the 2-adic (additive Haar) measure, so
`(ℤ₂, μ, T₂)` and `(ℤ₂, μ, S)` are isomorphic measure-preserving systems. Formerly the cited `axiom`
`BL.exists_metric_conjugacy` (in `BL.Basic`), it is now **proved**.

## The argument

`Φ` is already known to be **solenoidal** and **bijective** (`Φ_solenoidal`, `qMap_bijective`), hence
a **2-adic isometry** by Appendix A (`corollary_A3`): `‖Φ x − Φ y‖ = ‖x − y‖` (`Φ_isometry`). The
measure-preservation is then an instance of a general fact about ultrametric groups
(`ForMathlib/MeasureTheory/UltrametricMeasurePreserving.lean`,
`MeasureTheory.measurePreserving_of_surjective_isometry`):

> A continuous surjective isometry of a second-countable ultrametric normed additive group preserves
> every finite left-invariant measure.

The proof of that general lemma uses that in an ultrametric space the closed balls of positive radius
are clopen, form a topological basis (so they generate the Borel `σ`-algebra) and a `π`-system; a
finite left-invariant measure gives equal mass to balls of equal radius (translation invariance), and
a surjective isometry maps each ball onto a ball of the same radius, so it preserves the mass of every
ball, hence the whole measure (`π`-system uniqueness). No coset-counting or explicit value `μ(ball) =
2^{-n}` is needed — only that same-radius balls have *equal* measure.

This replaces the **Haar-pushforward analysis** that would otherwise be required: rather than computing
the pushforward `Φ_* μ` on cylinders directly, we exploit that `Φ` is a metric isometry.

## `T₂` is Bernoulli

With the metric conjugacy in hand, **`T₂` is Bernoulli** (`T₂_bernoulli`, moved here from `BL.Basic`
since it now depends on the downstream `exists_metric_conjugacy`): transport the Bernoulli structure of
the shift `S` (`S_bernoulli`, the cited [Kin09] p-adic digit fact) across the measure-preserving
conjugacy `Φ`. The conjugating equivalence `e ∘ Φ⁻¹` is measure-preserving and intertwines `T₂` with
the coordinate shift `seqShift`, because `Φ⁻¹ ∘ T₂ = S ∘ Φ⁻¹`.

## `T₂` is strongly mixing, measure-preserving, ergodic

Being Bernoulli, `T₂` is **strongly mixing** (`T₂_stronglyMixing`): any Bernoulli shift is strongly
mixing ([Quas09], `MeasureTheory.isStronglyMixing_infinitePi_shift`), and strong mixing transfers
across the conjugating isomorphism (`MeasureTheory.IsStronglyMixing.of_measurableEquiv`). Measure
preservation (`T₂_measurePreserving`) and ergodicity (`T₂_ergodic`) follow. These were cited
axioms / their consequences in `BL.Basic` (= [Lag85]); the single remaining mixing input is the
general cited [Quas09] fact in `ForMathlib`.

/-! ### 2-adic dynamics of `T₂`: strong mixing, measure preservation, ergodicity

Now that `T₂` is known to be **Bernoulli** (`T₂_bernoulli`), its 2-adic dynamics follow from the
general fact that a Bernoulli shift is strongly mixing ([Quas09],
`MeasureTheory.isStronglyMixing_infinitePi_shift`), transported across the conjugacy. These were
formerly cited axioms / their consequences in `BL.Basic`. -/

/-- **`T₂` is strongly mixing** on `ℤ₂` for the 2-adic Haar measure. `T₂` is Bernoulli
(`T₂_bernoulli`), and every Bernoulli system is strongly mixing
(`MeasureTheory.IsBernoulli.isStronglyMixing` — the Bernoulli shift is strongly mixing by the cited
[Quas09] fact `isStronglyMixing_infinitePi_shift`, transported across the isomorphism). Formerly a
cited `axiom` in `BL.Basic` (= [Lag85]); the sole mixing input is now the general [Quas09]
Bernoulli-mixing fact. -/
