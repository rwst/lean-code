# The depth-`K` certificate schema, in closed form (plan z32-transform, milestone M3)

`Z32/SymbolicCert.lean` (milestone M1) certifies the window `[s, s + 1/p)` whenever
`ε = {(p−q)s}` avoids two open bands.  Experiment X-P decomposed those two bands exactly and found
the decomposition to be the **same at every base** — the sign that the depth-`K` layer, like the
depth-one layer, is one closed-form schema rather than a table.  This file is that schema, and
this is a **formalization of known mathematics**: see "Provenance" below.

## The marked orbit

Rescale the window coordinate to `v = p·u ∈ [0,1)`, `u = {ξ(p/q)ⁿ − s}`.  The two surviving
carries `k`, `k+1` become the two branches

* **low**  `p(v + ε) < q`, and then `q·v' = p(v + ε)`;
* **high** `1 ≤ v + ε`,  and then `q·v' = p(v + ε − 1)`;

between them sits the *hole* `q/p − ε ≤ v < 1 − ε`, from which no step is possible.  Run this map
from the window's own left endpoint `v = 0`:

`w 0 = 0`,  `w (i+1) = ` the branch image of `w i`.

`Z32.Escape p q ε K w` says that orbit is defined for `K` steps and that `w K` lands in the hole
(`Z32.Escape.hit_lo`, `Z32.Escape.hit_hi`, with the right end taken closed, which folds in the
case where the orbit returns to `0`).  That single condition is the whole schema:

* `K = 0` is `q ≤ pε` — the second clause of `Z32.SchemaCertified`;
* `K = 1` is `q² ≤ p(p+q)ε ∧ (p+q)ε ≤ q` — the band, the third clause;
* `K ≥ 2` is what the two residual bands of M1 are made of.

`Z32.certifiedK_of_certified` records that containment.

## Why it certifies

The `K+1` marked points cut `[0,1)` into `K+1` arcs, and the *rank* `r(x) = #{i ≤ K : w i ≤ x}`
(`Z32.blockRank`) names the arc of `x`.  (`ν` is the orbit shift throughout the corpus, so the
rank is written `r` here and in the paper.)  The branch map is increasing on each branch and its two
images tile `[0,1)`, so it acts on the ranks as a **cyclic rotation**: with `N_L` marked points on
the low branch and `N_R` on the high one (`Z32.lowCount`, `Z32.highCount`, `N_L + N_R = K`),

`r(v') = r(v) + N_R + 1` on the low branch, and `r(v') + N_L = r(v)` on the high one

(`Z32.blockRank_step_low`, `Z32.blockRank_step_high`), while `r` also *decides* the branch
(`Z32.low_iff_blockRank_le`).  So along a confined orbit the rank sequence is deterministic with
values in `{1, …, K+1}`; it repeats, and the carry word — a function of the rank — is eventually
periodic, which `Z32.not_isEventuallyPeriodic_carry` ([DN05] Lemma 2) forbids.

No certificate data reaches the kernel: the proof is uniform in `p`, `q`, `s` and `K`.  (The two
`decide`s in the file check `Nat.Coprime 5 2` in the numeral instances at the end, nothing else.)

## The closed-form family

Taking the low branch `K` times (`Z32.lowOrbit`) gives an explicit interval of `ε` for every `K`,

`q^{K+1}(p−q) ≤ p·ε·(p^{K+1} − q^{K+1})`  and  `ε·(p^{K+1} − q^{K+1}) ≤ q^K(p−q)`

(`Z32.LowBand`, `Z32.ZSet_eq_empty_of_lowBand`), of length `q^K(p−q)²/(p(p^{K+1}−q^{K+1}))`.  At
`K = 1` it *is* the M1 band; at `K ≥ 2` it is a new band inside the old residual one — at `(5,2)`,
`K = 2` gives `[8/195, 4/39]` (`Z32.ZSet_five_two_depth_two`), which is 54% of the residual band by
itself, and the family covers about 87% of it.  In the notation of [Bug04] Lemma 3 this family is
`J_{K+1}^1(q/p)`; the other words give the intervals `J_b^a(q/p)` for the remaining rationals
`a/b`, which is why X-P found the cell decomposition to be base-independent — the cells are indexed
by rotation numbers, not by the base.

## Provenance, and what is new here

The mathematics is not new, and the corpus should not claim it is.

* [FLP95] Theorem 3.4 already gives the criterion, and the rotation with it: if `N` is least with
  `f^N(0) ≥ 1/β` then the survivor set is finite, with exactly `N` elements, *cyclically permuted*
  by the map.  `Z32.Escape` is that condition in the corpus's coordinates, and the rank rotation
  proved here is that cyclic permutation.
* [Bug04] Lemma 1 adds the returning case `f^N(0) = 0`, Lemma 2 makes the two together an
  *iff*, and Lemma 3 (from [Bug93], [BC99]) lists the resulting parameter intervals `J_b^a(γ)`
  explicitly, with the attractor a `b`-cycle carrying the dynamics of the rotation by `a/b` — the
  rank rotation proved here.
* [Bug04] Theorem 1 is the resulting statement `Z_{p/q}(s, s+1/p) = ∅` for a set of `s` of **full
  Lebesgue measure**, and [Bug04] Theorem 3 says the exceptional set is null, uncountable and not
  closed.  That is the plan's target T3 grade 2, in print since 2004.

What this file adds is a machine-checked form of the criterion and of the closed-form family,
uniform in `p`, `q`, `s`, `K`, with no data for the kernel to evaluate — and the identification of
`Z32.Escape` with the *depth* of the corpus's block certificates, which is what lets the
certificate engine and this theory talk to each other.

## Scope, honestly

As in `Z32/SymbolicCert.lean`: for `p < q²` the emptiness is [Dub09AA] Theorem 1, and for `p > q²`
and *algebraic* `ξ` it is [Dub19] Theorem 1.1; the statements here hold with no assumption on the
arithmetic nature of `ξ`.  Two sets of `ε` are not covered: `ε = 0` (already
`Z32.ZSet_zero_eq_empty`), and those whose marked orbit never escapes — by [Bug04] Theorem 1 these
are exactly the numbers `((p−q)/p)·Σ ε_{−k}(τ)(q/p)^k` for irrational `τ`, a null uncountable set
whose elements are transcendental by [BKLN21].  Their emptiness is open ([Bug04] §2: "we have not
been able to determine whether `Z_{p/q}(s, s+1/p)` is empty for all values of `s`"), which is the
plan's T3 grade 3.
