# Stage 1: the Diophantine kernel (K) and the reduction M4-from-(K)

Stage 1 of the M4/A3 program ([M4A3] §4): M4 (superlinear subword complexity of
the steering word) reduces by pigeonhole + Lemma R to a single Diophantine
statement, the **kernel (K)** — exponential pair repulsion for the orbit of
`(3/2)^n`:

  (K)  for every `θ < 1`, `‖(3/2)^c − (3/2)^a‖ ≤ θ^c` has only finitely many
       solutions `2 ≤ a < c`.

Here `θ` ranges over *rationals* in `(0, 1)` — no loss against the real
formulation (the sets are monotone in `θ` and `ℚ` is dense), and it keeps the
whole Stage-0/1 layer inside `ℚ`.  The trivial floor is `2^{-c}`
(`one_le_two_pow_mul_distToNearestInt_orbit`); (K) asks for any exponential
saving over it.

**The reduction** (`superlinear_of_kernel`): if `p_T(k) ≤ C·k` for some `k`,
pigeonhole among the `C·k + 1` windows starting at positions `2, …, C·k + 2`
gives a repetition `(a, c, k)` with `2 ≤ a < c ≤ C·k + 2 ≤ (C+2)·k`; Lemma R
contracts it to `‖(3/2)^c − (3/2)^a‖ ≤ (2/3)^k ≤ θ^c` for the *fixed* rational
scale `θ := 1 − (1/3)/(C+2)` (Bernoulli certificate `exists_pow_ge`:
`θ^{C+2} ≥ 2/3`), while the growth ceiling (`repetition_linear_bound`) forces
`c ≥ (41k − 24)/24 → ∞` — so (K) at the single scale `θ` bounds `k`.  Hence (K)
⟹ `p_T(k)/k → ∞`.

Everything here is std3 (no cited axioms): (K) is *consumed as a hypothesis*
(`Kernel`), never axiomatized — per the layered-QA policy the open kernel stays
a named hypothesis.  Its two unconditional slices (bounded gap, huge gap) are
proved from the CZ 2004 axiom in `TH.GapSlices`, and the conditional capstone
(middle band only) is `TH.CapstoneM4`.

## Contents

* `TH.kernelViolators` — the (K)-violating pairs at scale `θ`.
* `TH.PairRepulsion`, `TH.Kernel` — the kernel, per-scale and quantified.
* `TH.Superlinear` — the M4 target `p_T(k)/k → ∞`.
* `TH.exists_pow_ge` — rational Bernoulli certificate `∃ θ < 1, r ≤ θ^N`
  (trades the irrational `(2/3)^{1/N}` for a rational kernel scale).
* `TH.mem_kernelViolators_of_repetition` — the Lemma-R contraction of a
  repetition into the kernel.
* `TH.superlinear_of_kernel` — **the Stage-1 reduction**: (K) ⟹ M4.

/-- **Stage 1 reduction, (K) ⟹ M4** ([M4A3] §4): exponential pair repulsion at
every rational scale forces superlinear subword complexity of the steering word.
Proof: pigeonhole a failing `C` into a repetition, contract by Lemma R into
`kernelViolators θ` at the Bernoulli scale `θ(C)`, and let the growth ceiling
push `c → ∞` against the finiteness. -/
