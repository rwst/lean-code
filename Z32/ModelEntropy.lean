# `φ_model`: the entropy ledger of the carry model (plan-M5A9, milestone N2(a))

`plans/plan-M5A9.html` §2 refutes, at the level of the model, the external report's hoped-for
"every hole drops the entropy" theorem, and replaces it by a **quantitative ledger**: the entropy
`φ_model(U)` of the carry language of the hold set of `U`, which is `0` exactly where the atlas
certifies and *positive* on the band and at the small central holes.  This file defines that
quantity and proves both sides of the ledger.

## The object

With `xₙ = ⌊ξ(p/q)ⁿ⌋`, `yₙ = {ξ(p/q)ⁿ}` and the carry `sₙ = q·x_{n+1} − p·xₙ` the orbit obeys
`q·y_{n+1} = p·yₙ − sₙ` (`Z32.carry_eq`).  A **model orbit** (`Z32.IsModelOrbit`) is any sequence
in `[0,1)` obeying that relation and staying in `U` — the *hold set* of the interval map, which is
a strictly larger object than the set of genuine `ξ`-orbits.  Its **language**
(`Z32.modelLang`) is the set of carry words its orbits realise, and

`Z32.phiModel p q U := limsup (log #{words of length n}) / n`.

This is the plan's `φ_model(H) = log λ(H)`: on a certified entry the block graph is functional and
the two agree (both `0`); relating them in general is the transfer lemma of N2(c), which is *not*
in this file.

## The two sides

* **Zero on the certified entries.**  `Z32.phiModel_eq_zero_of_cert`: if a block certificate of
  `Z32/BlockCert.lean` has a functional block graph (`strata = []`), the whole carry word of a
  confined model orbit is determined by the block its orbit starts in
  (`Z32.card_modelLang_le_of_cert`, via the new `Z32.BlockCert.Cert.exists_block_path`), so the
  language has at most `#blocks` words of *every* length.  Read back as sets:
  `Z32.phiModel_eq_zero_window38` (`[1/6, 13/24)`) and `Z32.phiModel_eq_zero_frontier`
  (the `0.40722` frontier).
* **Positive on the band and at the two-cell hole.**  A `Z32.Horse` certificate is the mirror
  image of a funnel: a closed interval `K = [A/D, B/D]` and `N` distinct carry words of a common
  length `L`, each mapping `K` into itself under the *contracting inverse* branches
  `h_s(x) = (qx+s)/p` while visiting only points of `U`.  Then every concatenation of those words
  is realised — by the periodic orbit of its own fixed point, which lies in `K` by the intermediate
  value theorem (`Z32.Horse.exists_fixed`, `Z32.Horse.flatten_mem_modelLang`) — so the language has
  at least `N^k` words of length `kL` and `Z32.Horse.le_phiModel` gives `φ_model ≥ log N / L`.

`Z32.not_cert_and_horse` closes the ledger: no set carries both kinds of certificate.

## The entries

| set | certificate | `φ_model` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[1/6, 13/24)`, length `0.375` | `certWindow38` | `= 0` (`Z32.phiModel_eq_zero_window38`) |
| `[961/3600, 2427/3600)`, length `0.40722` | `certFrontier` | `= 0` (`Z32.phiModel_eq_zero_frontier`) |
| the other five `strata = []` entries | `certUnion712`, `certUnion23`, `certUnion2536`, `certFourThree`, `certFiveTwo` | `= 0` by `Z32.phiModel_eq_zero_of_cert` |
| band `[0, 5/12)`, past the frontier | `Z32.horseBand` (4 words, `L = 6`) | `≥ (log 2)/3 = 0.2310…` |
| band `[0, 5/12)` | `Z32.horseBandRecord` (14 words, `L = 10`) | `≥ (log 14)/10 = 0.2639…` |
| two-cell hole `[0,1/3) ∪ [2/3,1)` | `Z32.horseTwoCellSmall` (4 words, `L = 3`) | `≥ (log 4)/3 = 0.4621…` |
| two-cell hole `[0,1/3) ∪ [2/3,1)` | `Z32.horseTwoCell` (16 words, `L = 5`) | `≥ (4/5)·log 2 = 0.5545…` |

The band value `(log 2)/3` is exactly the figure plan-M5A9 §2 attributes to the cycle counts
`4/8/16` at periods `≤ 6/9/12`; the certificate turns that count — which by itself proves nothing
about growth — into a theorem, and `horseBandRecord` then passes it.  At the two-cell hole the
census of `Z32/README.md` measures a *full* `2`-shift (`2^L − 1` points of period dividing `L`);
`(4/5)·log 2` is what a certificate of length `5` proves of it.  The family
`N = 2^{L−1}`, `K = [0, (3^{L−1}−2^{L−1})/(3^L−2^L)]` continues at every `L`, so the certified
bound tends to `log 2`; no single certificate of this shape reaches it (at `L = 1` invariance would
force `K = [0,1]`), which is the honest form of the landmine in N2(d).

## What is *not* claimed

`φ_model` is a statement about the **model** — the hold set of the two-branch interval map — and
never about the actual sets of real `ξ` (plan risk R-B).  A positive `φ_model` says that *this
family of certificates* cannot decide the entry, and that the obstruction is exponential rather
than accidental; it says nothing about whether the underlying `Z`-set is empty.  At the two-cell
hole the underlying set is in fact known nonempty ([Dub10]), and at the band entry nothing is
known either way.

The zero side covers certificates with `strata = []`, which is seven of the eight entries.  The
rank-stratified `certDub08` also has `φ_model = 0` — a rank-`r` graph has polynomially many paths
— but that count is not formalized here; only the functional case is.

## Trust ledger

`std3` (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`) throughout: no cited axiom, no `sorry`, no
`native_decide`.  Every certificate is `decide`-checked from its literal data over one common
denominator, exactly as in `Z32/BlockCert.lean`; the search that produced the data
(`Z32/horseshoe.py`, exact `Fraction` arithmetic) is not trusted by anything here.

## Claim level

Formalization and measurement.  The horseshoe construction is the standard covering/IFS argument;
what is new is that the entries are kernel-checked, that the ledger's two colours are proved
disjoint, and that the plan's heuristic `(log 2)/3` is replaced by a theorem (and beaten).

/-! ## Positive `φ_model`: horseshoe certificates

The lower bound needs the opposite of a funnel: a closed interval `K = [A/D, B/D]` and a list of
distinct carry words of a common length `L`, each of which maps `K` back **into** `K` under the
contracting inverse branches `h_s(x) = (qx+s)/p`, visiting only points of `U` on the way.  Then
every concatenation of those words is itself such a word, its (unique) periodic point lies in `K`
by the intermediate value theorem, and its whole orbit lies in `U` — so the language has at least
`Nʲ` words of length `jL` and `φ_model ≥ log N / L`. -/

/-- The **backward branch** applied along a word: `back p q z w` is the point that follows the
carry word `w` and arrives at `z`.  One step is `h_s(x) = (q·x + s)/p`, the inverse of the forward
branch `f_s(y) = (p·y − s)/q`. -/

/-- **The two-cell hole carries almost the full shift entropy.**  `U = [0,1/3) ∪ [2/3,1)` is the
trap `‖ξ(3/2)ⁿ‖ < 1/3`, which [Dub10] proves *nonempty*; the census of `Z32/README.md` measures a
full `2`-shift there, and the certificate proves `φ_model ≥ (4/5)·log 2`, i.e. at least `80 %` of
it. -/
