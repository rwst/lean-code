# The quantitative Ridout theorem of Bugeaud–Evertse (2008), Cor. 5.2 — cited

The **line cover** produced by the quantitative Subspace Theorem: for a fixed exponent budget
`2 + ε` distributed over the archimedean place and finitely many primes, all *high* solutions of
the associated approximation system lie on an explicitly bounded number of lines through the
origin.

## The source statement, verbatim

[BE08], §5, pp. 8–9.  Let `S₁, S₂` be finite, possibly empty sets of primes, `S := {∞} ∪ S₁ ∪ S₂`,
let `ξ` be an algebraic number of degree `d`, let `ε > 0`, and let `f_p` (`p ∈ S`) be reals with

> `f_p ≥ 0` for `p ∈ S`, `∑_{p ∈ S} f_p = 2 + ε`.  (5.10)

Consider the system of inequalities

> `|ξ − x/y| ≤ y^{−f_∞}`, `|x|_p ≤ y^{−f_p}` (`p ∈ S₁`), `|y|_p ≤ y^{−f_p}` (`p ∈ S₂`),
> in `(x, y) ∈ ℤ²` with `y > 0`.  (5.11)

Define the height of `ξ` by `H(ξ) := ∏_{v ∈ M_K} max(1, ‖ξ‖_v)`.

> **Corollary 5.2.** *The set of solutions of (5.11) with*
> `y > max(2H(ξ), 2^{4/ε})`  (5.12)
> *is contained in the union of at most*
> `2³²(1 + ε⁻¹)³ log(6d) log((1 + ε⁻¹) log(6d))`  (5.13)
> *one-dimensional linear subspaces of ℚ².*

Two features of the source are load-bearing and are reproduced below without weakening:

* the conclusion counts **one-dimensional subspaces** (lines), *not* solutions — [BE08] contains
  no per-line multiplicity statement anywhere, and Theorem 5.1 behind it has the same shape;
* the conclusion is restricted to **large height** `y > max(2H(ξ), 2^{4/ε})`; solutions below the
  threshold are not covered at all.

## What is recorded here

`ridout_line_cover` is Cor. 5.2 at `d = 1` (so `ξ ∈ ℚ` and `log(6d) = log 6`) and **arbitrary
finite sets of primes** `S₁`, `S₂`, as in the source.  A one-dimensional subspace of `ℚ²` meeting
the region `y > 0` is determined by the slope `x/y ∈ ℚ` of any of its points, so the line cover is
recorded as a `Finset ℚ` of slopes of cardinality at most `lineBound ε`.  Varying the sets and the
exponents `f_p` inside the budget `2 + ε` is what lets one axiom serve every frame in the corpus.

Two readings of the source have to be pinned down, and both are resolved *against* the axiom (the
recorded statement is the weaker one in each case):

* the budget (5.10) sums over `S = {∞} ∪ S₁ ∪ S₂`, i.e. over the **union** — a prime in both sets
  would contribute once;
* the deduction of Cor. 5.2 from Thm 5.1 on p. 9 sets `e₁ₚ = −f_p, e₂ₚ = 0` for `p ∈ S₁` and
  `e₁ₚ = 0, e₂ₚ = −f_p` for `p ∈ S₂`, which is consistent only for **disjoint** `S₁`, `S₂`.  The
  axiom therefore carries `Disjoint S₁ S₂` as a hypothesis.  Every application has it for free:
  `S₁` is the set of primes of the denominator base and `S₂` that of the numerator base, and the
  two bases are coprime.

Two derived forms are provided, and are what consumers use:

* `ridout_line_cover_23` — the instance `S₁ = {2}`, `S₂ = {3}` of the `‖(3/2)ⁿ‖` problems;
* `ridout_line_cover_pow` — the **coprime-power engine**: for coprime `P, Q` it packages the whole
  per-prime bookkeeping into the two hypotheses `Qⁿ ∣ x` and `y = Pⁿ`, with the budget in the
  closed form `f_∞ + log Q/log P + 1 = 2 + ε`.  This is the form the general effective Mahler
  line-count of `BB13/MahlerFrame.lean` runs on.

## Widening notice (2026-07-22)

Until 2026-07-22 the recorded axiom was the narrow instance now called `ridout_line_cover_23`
(`S₁ = {2}`, `S₂ = {3}`).  It was replaced by the source's own generality — the same theorem, cited
less narrowly — and the narrow form derived from it, so no footprint changed.  The gain is the
general effective Mahler line count of `BB13/MahlerFrame.lean` (report C.8) and rational
multipliers (C.9); see `plans/plan-BB13-generalize.html`.

## Retirement notice (2026-07-21)

This file **replaces** `CITED/CorvajaZannierEffective.lean`, whose axiom
`CZ.pseudoPisot_approx_effective` asserted a bound on the *number of solutions*,
`#A(δ, ε) ≤ (|num δ| + den δ) · K(ε)`.  That statement is **not** Cor. 5.2: passing from the line
count to a solution count needs a uniform bound on the number of solutions per line, which is the
open problem [BE08] itself flags (Remark 7.4) and which Corvaja–Zannier's *ineffective* finiteness
cannot supply.  Under the house policy on cited axioms (literature-proved statements only, never
open ones) it was deleted, together with its consumers' count corollaries; the repaired counts are
conditional on an explicit per-line hypothesis (`BB13/FailureCount.lean`).  See
`plans/plan2-BB13.html`, and `plans/report-BB13.md`, `plans/report2-BB13.md` for the two referee
reports that identified the error.

/-- **Quantitative Ridout** ([BE08], Cor. 5.2), the instance `d = 1` (`ξ ∈ ℚ`) with arbitrary
finite sets of primes `S₁`, `S₂`: for exponents `fInf ≥ 0` and `f l ≥ 0` (`l ∈ S₁ ∪ S₂`) with
`fInf + ∑_{l ∈ S₁ ∪ S₂} f l = 2 + ε` — the source's (5.10) — there is a set `R` of at most
`lineBound ε` slopes such that **every** solution `(x, y) ∈ ℤ²`, `y > 0`, of the system (5.11)

* `|ξ − x/y| ≤ y^{−fInf}`,
* `|x|_l ≤ y^{−f l}` for `l ∈ S₁`,
* `|y|_l ≤ y^{−f l}` for `l ∈ S₂`

whose height satisfies (5.12), `y > max(2H(ξ), 2^{4/ε})`, has `x/y ∈ R` — i.e. lies on one of at
most `lineBound ε` lines through the origin.

Recorded as a cited `axiom` on the authority of [BE08] Cor. 5.2 (via [ES02]); the source statement
is quoted verbatim in the module docstring, and the two readings it leaves open are resolved
against the axiom there (sum over the union; `Disjoint S₁ S₂`).  Note what is **not** asserted:
nothing bounds the number of solutions on a single line, and nothing is said about solutions of
height below the threshold. -/

/-! ### The coprime-power engine

The form every application of the corpus actually needs: the solutions have `y = Pⁿ` and `x`
divisible by `Qⁿ` for coprime bases `P, Q`, and the per-prime exponents are then forced —
`v_l(Q)·log l/log P` on the primes of `Q` and `v_l(P)·log l/log P` on those of `P`, with sums
`log Q/log P` and `1`.  The lemmas below do that bookkeeping once and for all. -/

`Pⁿ > max(2H(ξ), 2^{4/ε})` and `|ξ − x/Pⁿ| ≤ (Pⁿ)^{−fInf}`.

The budget of (5.10) is spent as follows: `fInf` at the infinite place; `v_l(Q)·log l/log P` at
each prime `l` of `Q` (summing to `log Q/log P`, and paid for by `Qⁿ ∣ x`); `v_l(P)·log l/log P` at
