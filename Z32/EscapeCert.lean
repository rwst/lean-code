# Per-position escape certificates at length ⅓ (plan-cert32 §3, milestone M1)

The `FLP/` chain reduces emptiness of `Z_{3/2}(s, s+⅓)` to a **finite** computation: by
`FLP.ZSet_eq_empty_of_survivors_finite` (their Thm 3.2) and `FLP.survivors_finite` (their Thm 3.4)
it suffices that the orbit of the origin under `f_{3/2,α}(x) = {3x/2 + α}`, `α = {(p−q)s} = {s}`,
escapes the interval `[0, 2/3)` at some finite time `N`.  This file runs that computation at the
five positions of **FLP95 Corollary 1.4a** and records the results as theorems:

| `s`   | orbit of `0` under `x ↦ {3x/2 + s}`            | escape time |
|-------|------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `0`   | fixed at `0` — no escape                        | (endpoint argument, `FLP.ZSet_empty_zero`) |
| `1/6` | `0 ↦ 1/6 ↦ 5/12 ↦ 19/24`                        | `N = 3` |
| `1/3` | `0 ↦ 1/3 ↦ 5/6`                                 | `N = 2` |
| `1/2` | `0 ↦ 1/2 ↦ 1/4 ↦ 7/8`                           | `N = 3` |
| `2/3` | `0 ↦ 2/3`                                       | `N = 1` |

The witnesses `N = 3, 2, 3, 1` are exactly the ones FLP95 uses in its proof of Cor 1.4a (gate G-1,
`plans/plan-cert32.html` §3.1), so `Z32.FLP_cor_one_four_a` is the **X1 control** of the plan: a
kernel-checked replay of the paper's own certificates, with known answers.  Everything is exact
rational arithmetic through `FLP.lmo_of_lt` / `FLP.lmo_of_ge`; no `native_decide`, no cited axioms.

These five windows, of length `⅓` and at spacing `⅙`, are also all that milestone M1 needs: they
cover every cell `[r/m, (r+1)/m)` with `m ≥ 3` (see `Z32/ResidueCapture.lean`).

## Contents

* `Z32.alphaSym_three_two` — for `p/q = 3/2` the FLP offset is `{s}`.
* `Z32.ZSet_third_empty_of_escape` — the certificate scheme: an escape witness at `s` kills
  `Z_{3/2}(s, s+⅓)`.
* `Z32.escape_one_sixth`, `Z32.escape_one_third`, `Z32.escape_one_half`, `Z32.escape_two_thirds` —
  the four finite orbits.
* `Z32.FLP_cor_one_four_a` — FLP95 Cor 1.4a: `Z_{3/2}(s, s+⅓) = ∅` for `s ∈ {0, ⅙, ⅓, ½, ⅔}`.

X1, the control run): `Z_{3/2}(s, s+⅓) = ∅` for each of the five positions
`s ∈ {0, ⅙, ⅓, ½, ⅔}`.  For `s = 0` this is `FLP.ZSet_empty_zero` (the origin is a fixed point, so
there is no escape witness and the paper argues separately); the other four are the finite orbits
above. -/
