Ported from the Formal Conjectures project
(FormalConjectures/Books/BugeaudDistributionModuloOne/IntDistanceDistribution.lean)
to this repository's annotation set. Changes from the original:
  * `distToNearestInt` is defined locally (was in `FormalConjecturesForMathlib`),
    so it is a bespoke corpus def and shows up as a `states_with` target;
  * Problem 10.1 is stated as a plain existence proposition (the FC `answer(…)`
    question-wrapper is not part of this repo);
  * references / attributions / groupings use this repo's attributes
    (`ref`, `group`, `conjectured_by`, `extern_id`, `formal_uses`,
    `informal_uses`, and the `informal_result` registry).

Problem 10.1. Are there a transcendental number $\alpha$ with $|\alpha| > 1$ and a
positive real $\xi$ such that $\lVert \xi \alpha^n \rVert \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$?
(Trivial for $|\alpha| < 1$.) Originally raised by Hardy [Har19].

Waldschmidt [Wal03] conjectured a stronger result: there exists $c > 0$ such that
$\lVert e^n \rVert > n^{-c}$ for every $n \ge 1$. Supported by metrical results [Kok45].

/--
Waldschmidt's conjecture is stronger than Mahler's: since $\log n \le n$ for $n \ge 1$,
the polynomial lower bound $n^{-c}$ dominates the exponential bound $e^{-cn}$. This is
a proved reduction. It `formal_uses` `waldschmidt` (the statement it consumes as
hypothesis); it does *not* `formal_uses problem_10_3`, which it concludes.
