# Completeness of the certificate scheme (plan z32-transform, milestone M4, target T5)

`Z32/BlockCert.lean` proves the certificate scheme **sound**: a valid certificate for `U` forbids
every `ξ ≠ 0` from keeping its whole orbit `{ξ(p/q)ⁿ}` inside `U`.  This file proves the converse
half — what the scheme *can* decide, and what obstructs it — on the class the plan names: sets
whose **hold set** is finite.

## The hold set

`Z32.holdSet p q U` is the set of points of `U` that carry an infinite orbit of the carry relation
`q·y_{n+1} = p·yₙ − sₙ` inside `U`.  It is the model-level survivor set: a certificate's blocks
cover it, and a real orbit confined to `U` runs inside it.

## Main results

* `Z32.holdSet_finite_imp` (**T5(i), completeness**) — if `holdSet p q U` is finite then no `ξ ≠ 0`
  has its orbit confined to `U`, so `U`'s verdict is *empty*: on that class the scheme's answer is
  never "unknown", and the answer is always the one a certificate would give.
* `Z32.isEventuallyPeriodic_of_finite_range` — the engine behind it: an orbit of the carry relation
  in `[0,1)` taking only finitely many values has an eventually periodic carry word.  Two steps:
  a value visited twice is rational with denominator `p^P − q^P` (`Z32.hasDenom_of_return`, the
  plan's conjecture **C‑2** at every base), and a point whose denominator is coprime to `q` has at
  most **one** successor in `[0,1)` whose denominator is coprime to `q` (`Z32.step_unique`), so the
  recurrent part of the dynamics is *deterministic*.
* `Z32.BlockCert.Cert.eq_of_memI_block` (**T5(iii), the obstruction**) — for an *unranked*
  certificate (`strata = []`) two confined orbits that ever share a block are equal.  Hence
  `Z32.BlockCert.Cert.ok_eq_false_of_infinite_hold`: a set with infinitely many hold points admits
  no unranked certificate **at any depth**.
* `Z32.cyclePoint_eq_base` (**C‑2 at every base**) — a `P`-periodic point of the carry relation is
  `A/(p^P − q^P)`; the corpus had `Z32.cycle_point_eq` at `3/2` only.
* `Z32.BlockCert.certTwoCellFifthClosed` and four more closed-convention entries — the certificates
  the corrected picture predicts, one of them for a set this corpus had recorded as refused.

## What the plan asked for, and what is here

T5(i) asks for "a certificate exists at computable depth"; what is proved is the *conclusion* the
certificate would give (`Z_{p/q}(U) = ∅`), on the same class, plus the structure theory that says
which certificate shape can work.  Producing the `Cert` **data** from the finite hold set — the
funnel as an explicit list of integer intervals — is the one step not formalized here; it is
combinatorics of interval lists, not dynamics, and `Z32/gencert.py` does it.

T5(iii) asked for "the closed-convention obstruction is exactly an endpoint-touching cycle".  That
is **false as stated**: the closed `[0,1/5] ∪ [4/5,1]` has the endpoint cycle `1/5 ↔ 4/5` and a
certificate all the same (`certTwoCellFifthClosed`, depth 1), and so does the closed `[Dub08]`
union.  The true obstruction to the *unranked* scheme is an **infinite hold set**, which is what an
endpoint cycle usually produces: at `[0,1/5] ∪ [4/5,1]` the points `(1/5)(2/3)^k` are all held, and
`Z32.BlockCert.Cert.ok_eq_false_of_covers_two_cell` turns the engine's "no certificate to depth 60" into a
theorem.  Ranks are exactly the device that survives an infinite hold set, which is why [Dub08]
needed them.

/-! ## Scaled points

Everything below turns on one invariant of the carry relation: the **denominator** of a point,
and specifically whether it is coprime to `q`.  `HasDenom D y` says `D·y` is an integer; it is
deliberately not "the" denominator, so that two points can always be put over a common one. -/

/-- **The determinism lemma.**  A point has at most one successor in `[0,1)` whose denominator is
coprime to `q`.

Why: with `u, v, v'` over a common denominator `D` coprime to `q`, the recursion reads
`q·b = p·a − s·D` and `q·c = p·a − s'·D`, so `D ∣ q(b − c)`, hence `D ∣ b − c`; and `b`, `c` both
lie in `[0, D)`.  The `q` admissible carries at a point of `[0,1)` are `q` consecutive integers,
so exactly one of them keeps the denominator coprime to `q` — that is the arithmetic reason the
recurrent dynamics is a *function* and not a relation. -/

/-! ## Completeness on the finite-hold-set class (T5(i))

The two lemmas above combine into the statement the plan calls completeness: on the class of sets
whose hold set is finite, the scheme's verdict is always *empty*, and it is right.  Nothing about
intervals enters — the only hypothesis is that the orbit takes finitely many values. -/

/-- **The completeness engine.**  An orbit of the carry relation inside `[0,1)` that takes only
finitely many values has an **eventually periodic** carry word.

Proof: some value `v` recurs infinitely often, so from the first visit on every point of the orbit
lies on a loop, hence (`hasDenom_of_return`) is a rational with denominator `p^P − q^P`, coprime to
`q`.  On that class the relation is a *function* (`step_unique`), so equal values at two times force
equal values ever after; the orbit is therefore periodic from the first visit, and with it the
carry word. -/

`funcOk` with `strata = []` asks the block graph to be a genuine partial function.  That is a
statement about *blocks*, but it has an exact consequence for *points*: distinct confined orbits
must live in distinct blocks, so a set with more held points than blocks admits no unranked
certificate.  Since the number of blocks is finite whatever the depth, an **infinite hold set**
refutes the unranked scheme at every depth — which is precisely the situation an endpoint cycle
creates, and precisely what rank strata were introduced to survive. -/

/-! ### The two-cell arc with closed endpoints

`Z32.BlockCert.certTwoCellFifth` certifies the **half-open** `[0,1/5) ∪ [4/5,1)`, and the file's
note records that the engine's search "finds no certificate to depth 60" once the endpoints are
closed.  Both halves of that story are now theorems, and they say different things:

* no **unranked** certificate exists, at any depth — because closing `1/5` admits the whole chain
  `(1/5)(2/3)^k` into the hold set, which is therefore infinite
  (`Cert.ok_eq_false_of_two_cell_chain`);
* a **ranked** certificate does exist, at depth `1` (`certTwoCellFifthClosed`).

So the engine's refusal was a refusal of the unranked search, not of the set; `--ranked` was never
tried here.  The theory of this file predicted the second bullet from the first. -/
