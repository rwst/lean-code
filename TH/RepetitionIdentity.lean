# Lemma R: the repetition identity for the (3/2)ⁿ steering word

Stage 0 of the M4/A3 program, part 2 ([M4A3] §3.2–3.3).  A **repetition** is a
length-`k` factor of the steering word occurring at two positions `a < c`
(occurrences may overlap; nothing anchors them to the prefix — the dynamics is
autonomous, so all constants are position-uniform, in contrast to
Adamczewski–Bugeaud's prefix-anchored Condition (∗)).

Because equal factors accumulate equal circuit sums (`W_eq_of_repetition`), the
closed form `W(a,k) = 3^k ε_a − 2^k ε_{a+k}` of `TH.Basic` collapses every
repetition into **Lemma R**:

  `3^k (ε_c − ε_a) = 2^k (ε_{c+k} − ε_{a+k})`   (`lemmaR_eps`)
  `3^k (m_c − m_a) = 2^k (m_{c+k} − m_{a+k})`   (`lemmaR_int`)

with three quantitative shadows:

* **divisibility** — `2^k ∣ m_c − m_a` and `3^k ∣ m_{c+k} − m_{a+k}`
  (`gcd(2,3) = 1`);
* **contraction** — `|ε_c − ε_a| ≤ (2/3)^k` (`abs_eps_sub_le_of_repetition`):
  a long repetition forces two orbit points exponentially close — the interface
  to the Diophantine kernel (K) of [M4A3] §4–5;
* **growth ceiling** — for `2 ≤ a < c`, `2^k ≤ m_c − m_a ≤ m_c` bounds the
  repetition length: `2^(k+c+1) ≤ 3^(c+1)` (`repetition_pow_le`), i.e.
  `k ≲ 0.585·c` — pure integer arithmetic, no logarithms.

Elementary harvest, no Diophantine input:

* **T0.2 (milestone M1)**: the steering word is **not eventually periodic**
  (`not_eventually_periodic`) — a fixed-gap repetition of every length beats the
  growth ceiling.
* **T0.3**: `j`-fold repetitions of a length-`p` block are quantitatively
  forbidden late in the word (`power_repetition_bound`).
* the trivial repulsion floor `|ε_c − ε_a| ≥ 2^{-c}`
  (`one_le_two_pow_mul_abs_eps_sub`), from oddness of the numerators `R`.

Novelty status (M-0 gate, resolved 2026-07-05): the identity-and-divisibility
machinery is **known** for the sibling objects — AFS 2008 eq. (4) + Lemmas 6/8
(shared continuations force `q^k`-congruences in base 3/2), [Kop21] Lemma 3.8 (the
same telescoping identity for companion words of arbitrary reals; Lemma R is its
`ξ₁ = (3/2)^a, ξ₂ = (3/2)^c` instance in round convention), and aperiodicity
(T0.2) is a special case of [DN05] Lemma 1.  Not previously stated for the
nearest-integer steering word of the orbit of 1; this file is a transport of that
machinery plus, to our knowledge, its first formalization.

**Amended 2026-08-11** (plan-Tshift-S11 gate G-B, sweep #2 —
`plans/note-Tshift-S11-WPE.html`): the closest printed antecedent is a fourth
paper the M-0 gate missed, and it is one this corpus already formalizes.
[Dub09] Theorem 3 proves `liminf P(w,n)/n ≥ log q/log(p/q)` for the word
`w_n = q x_{n+1} − p x_n` of the ceiling orbit `x_n = ⌈p x_{n−1}/q⌉`, by
*exactly* the growth ceiling below: two equal length-`m` windows at `s < n` give
`q^m ∣ x_n − x_s` while `x_n ≤ (p/q)^n (x₀ + q − 1)`, so
`m log q < n log(p/q) + O(1)` — `repetition_pow_le` with the roles of the two
divisibilities exchanged, counted over windows instead of over sojourns.  Its
Corollary 4 is the `3/2` case, `P(X,n) > 1.70951129·n`.  In-corpus:
`RB/DubickasFloor.lean` (report-dubickas A.6) formalizes [Dub09] Thm 5 and
Cor 4 with `RB.dubickasConst = log 2/log(3/2)`, the reciprocal of this file's
slope; the T-shift floor-convention port is `TShift/FreeSojourn.lean`, whose
`κ_free = log₂(3/2) = 1/RB.dubickasConst`.

Three conventions of one inequality now live in the corpus — *round* here
(`2^(k+c+1) ≤ 3^(c+1)`), *floor* in `TShift.carry_repetition_pow_le`
(`2^(k+c) ≤ 3^c`), *ceiling* in `RB.Collatz.T_iter_growth`
(`2^n (y_n + 1) ≤ 3^n (y₀ + 1)`) — about three genuinely different words.  Not
duplication; no refactor is called for.  The amendment costs nothing downstream:
`TH.complexity_superlinear` (`p_T(k)/k → ∞`, via the subspace kernel) is
strictly stronger than [Dub09] Cor 4's linear floor and is not scooped by it,
and the M-0 verdict — first formalization of the round-convention machinery —
is unchanged.
