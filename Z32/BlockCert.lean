# Block certificates: kernel-checked emptiness of `Z_{p/q}(U)` (milestones M3, M6)

The engines of `plans/plan-cert32.html` milestone M2 (`Z32/atlas.c`, `Z32/verify_atlas.py`) decide
confinement questions numerically.  This file is the **bridge**: it turns one of their outputs into
a Lean theorem, checked by the kernel with `decide` — no `native_decide`, no floating point, no
cited axiom.

## What a certificate is

Fix coprime `p > q > 1` and write the orbit as `xₙ = ⌊ξ(p/q)ⁿ⌋`, `yₙ = {ξ(p/q)ⁿ}`, with carry word
`sₙ = q·x_{n+1} − p·xₙ` ([Dub09AA] (2), `Z32.carry`).  Eliminating `x` gives `Z32.carry_eq`,

`q·y_{n+1} = p·yₙ − sₙ`,  `sₙ ∈ {−q+1, …, p−1}`,

so confinement of `y` to a finite union of rational intervals `U` is survival under a
`(p+q−1)`-branch interval map (four branches at `3/2`, six at `4/3`).  A **certificate** for `U` is
a funnel of interval lists

`T₀ = U ⊇ T₁ ⊇ ⋯ ⊇ T_K =: H`

subject to two checks, both pure integer arithmetic over one common denominator `D`:

* `Z32.BlockCert.funnelOk` — for every `I ∈ T_k`, every carry `s` and every `J ∈ U`, the piece
  `{y ∈ J : (py−s)/q ∈ I}` lies inside a **single** interval of `T_{k+1}`.  Consequence: a confined
  orbit lies in `T_k` for every `k`, hence in the **blocks** `H`.
* `Z32.BlockCert.funcOk` — the block graph is deterministic *up to rank*: with the blocks stratified
  by a rank, no block has a successor of larger rank, and each has at most one successor of its own
  rank.  Consequence: the rank along a confined orbit is a non-increasing sequence of naturals,
  hence eventually constant, and from that point the block itinerary is *deterministic*, so by
  pigeonhole it is eventually periodic, and with it the carry word.  Taking `strata := []` gives
  every block rank `0` and recovers the plain "at most one outgoing edge" condition, which is what
  seven of the eight entries below use.

But the carry word of every `ξ ≠ 0` is **aperiodic** (`Z32.not_isEventuallyPeriodic_carry`, proved
in `Z32/DubickasWord.lean`).  Hence no `ξ ≠ 0` is confined to `U`.

This is the plan's `CYCLE` certificate.  Note what it does *not* need: no finiteness criterion for
the survivor set, no decoupling, no generalization of [FLP95] Theorem 3.2 beyond window length
`1/p` — which is why plan risk R-8 is closed by it (see plan §4.4).  It also does not need `ξ > 0`,
and it applies to unions verbatim.

## Main results

* `Z32.BlockCert.Cert.not_confined` — the soundness theorem: a valid certificate for `U` forbids
  every `ξ ≠ 0` from having its whole `(p/q)`-power orbit confined to `U` (mod 1).  The base is the
  certificate's own, and `ok` checks that it is admissible, so there is no side hypothesis.
* `Z32.BlockCert.Cert.not_eventually_confined` — the same for *eventual* confinement.
* `Z32.BlockCert.ZSet_eq_empty_of_cert` — the `FLP.ZSet` form, for a window covered by `U`.

Eight certified entries, each `decide`-checked.  Six at `3/2`:

* `Z32.ZSet_three_two_sixth_3_8` — `Z_{3/2}(1/6, 13/24) = ∅`, window length `3/8 = 0.375 > 1/3`:
  the **first entry beyond the [FLP95] line** (which stops at `1/p = 1/3`) and beyond [Dub09AA]
  (all `s`, but only at length `1/3`).  `Z32.not_eventually_mem_sixth_3_8` is its eventual form.
* `Z32.ZSet_three_two_frontier` — `Z_{3/2}(961/3600, 2427/3600) = ∅`, length
  `1466/3600 = 0.40722…`: the **engine frontier** of plan §4.4 experiment X2.
* `Z32.dubickas_2008_cor_1_2` — `[8/39,18/39] ∪ [21/39,31/39]`, total length `20/39`: [Dub08]
  Corollary 1.2 **as printed, with both intervals closed**, the strongest published *explicit*
  union-emptiness result.  The only entry here that needs both of the certificate's general
  features (closed endpoints and a rank stratification); see the convention note below.
* `Z32.union_seven_twelfths_empty`, `Z32.union_two_thirds_empty`, `Z32.union_record_empty` —
  unions of total length `7/12`, `2/3` and `25/36 = 0.6944…`, all past `20/39`.  Note that
  [KK18] Corollary 4.8 exhibits a *nonempty* union of the **same** total length `2/3`: total
  length alone decides nothing.

and two at other bases (milestone M6):

* `Z32.ZSet_four_three_beyond_line` — `Z_{4/3}(1/3, 5/8) = ∅`, length `7/24 = 0.2916… > 1/4`: the
  `(4,3)` analogue of the first entry, past the length-`1/p` line at a second base.
* `Z32.ZSet_five_two_fifth` — `Z_{5/2}(1/5, 2/5) = ∅`, in the regime `p > q²` that [Dub09AA] §4
  leaves open.  Read its docstring before quoting it: the engine certifies every *rational* window
  of length `1/p` tested in that regime, but the open statement is about *every real* position, and
  the cover argument that would bridge the two is measured to fail.

The certified windows are not vacuous: at `[1/6, 13/24)` the surviving set of the interval map is
the 3-cycle `4/19 → 6/19 → 9/19` (carries `0, 0, 1`), which is nonempty.  What the certificate
rules out is a *real number* whose fractional parts follow it, and that is exactly what
aperiodicity of the carry word forbids.  Three lemmas record that the checks have teeth:
`Z32.BlockCert.ok_eq_false_of_full` (`[0,1)` fails), `ok_eq_false_of_full_closed` (so does `[0,1]`
with a rank of its own) and `ok_eq_false_of_not_coprime` (a non-coprime base is refused — at
`4/2 = 2` the point `ξ = 1/3` really is periodic).

## Conventions

Intervals are half-open, `[a/D, b/D)`, the corpus `Ico` standard (`FLP.ZSet`), unless the
certificate sets `closed := true`, in which case every interval it mentions is `[a/D, b/D]`.  The
carry is [Dub09AA]'s `sₙ = q·x_{n+1} − p·xₙ`, the negative of the `e` printed by `Z32/atlas.c`.

**The convention is not cosmetic where the literature is closed.**  Emptiness for a larger set is a
stronger statement, so a closed-interval result implies its half-open shadow and not conversely.
[Dub08] Corollary 1.2 is printed closed, and the gap is real rather than notational: the closed set
genuinely holds a 4-cycle of the interval map through the right endpoint,
`6/13 → 9/13 → 7/13 → 4/13 → 6/13`, which the half-open set does not contain.  That cycle is also
why the half-open machinery alone does not reach it — with the endpoints in, the hold set acquires
infinitely many transients feeding two disjoint cycles, and *no* partition into blocks with one
outgoing edge each exists at any depth (measured to depth 40).  What does exist, at depth 3, is a
rank stratification, which is why `funcOk` is stated by rank.  Both features are opt-in and default
to the old behaviour, so the other entries are unchanged.

The base `p/q` is likewise a certificate field defaulting to `3/2`, so a `(3,2)` certificate never
mentions it (milestone M6).

The certificates are generated by `Z32/gencert.py`, which re-runs the exact pruning and emits the
funnel; nothing in this file trusts the engines — the kernel rechecks both conditions from scratch.

/-! ## Integer intervals

Everything is scaled by one common denominator `D`, so that every check below is an inequality
between integers: no rational arithmetic reaches the kernel.  `min` and `max` are expanded by hand
into disjunctions for the same reason — an order-theoretic `max` on `ℤ` unfolds through
`LinearOrder` projections, which `decide` does not enjoy. -/

the certificate's `closed` flag. -/

/-! ### The carry alphabet

From `q·y_{n+1} = p·yₙ − sₙ` with `yₙ, y_{n+1} ∈ [0,1)` one gets `−q < sₙ < p`, so the alphabet is
`{−q+1, …, p−1}` — exactly `p + q − 1` letters (four at `(3,2)`, six at `(4,3)`).  Built by an
explicit structural recursion rather than `List.range` + `List.map`, because the kernel unfolds it
directly and because membership is then a two-line induction. -/

*flipped* convention `rle (!cl)`, which is why the four emptiness disjuncts carry `!cl` while the

/-! ### Ranked determinism

Requiring *one* outgoing edge per block is more than the soundness proof needs, and more than some
hold sets can supply: a set whose hold set carries transients feeding a cycle has blocks with two
successors, one of them a strictly-nearer-the-cycle block.  What the proof actually needs is that
the itinerary is *eventually* forced, and that follows from a rank:

* successors never increase the rank, so the rank along an orbit is non-increasing, hence
  eventually constant (it is a `ℕ`);
* each block has at most one successor of its **own** rank, so from that moment the itinerary is
  deterministic.

`strata` lists the blocks by rank, lowest first; `strata = []` gives every block rank `0` and
recovers the plain "at most one outgoing edge" condition verbatim. -/

/-- **The funnel and the block graph, at the level of the model.**  This is everything the
soundness theorem below establishes *before* aperiodicity enters: the funnel pushes a confined
orbit into the blocks, and consecutive blocks are joined by an edge of the block graph labelled by
the carry.

It is stated for an abstract sequence `y` in `[0,1)` obeying the two-branch recursion rather than

/-- **Soundness of a block certificate.**  If `c.ok` then no `ξ ≠ 0` has its whole `(p/q)`-power
orbit confined, mod 1, to the set described by `c.U`.

The proof: the funnel pushes the orbit into the blocks (`Cert.exists_block_path`); the rank of the
block is non-increasing along the orbit, hence eventually constant, and from that moment the block
graph is a partial function, so the itinerary is deterministic, hence eventually periodic by
pigeonhole, hence the carry word is eventually periodic — contradicting
`Z32.not_isEventuallyPeriodic_carry`.

Nothing here is special to `3/2`: the aperiodicity lemma holds for every coprime `p > q > 1`, and
`c.ok` checks exactly those three conditions on the certificate's own base, which is why this
theorem needs no side hypothesis. -/

/-! ### The two-cell arc `‖·‖ < 1/5` (the nearest-integer family)

The certified sets above are windows and unions chosen by the search.  This one is a *named*
family: `[0, c) ∪ [1-c, 1)` is `{y : ‖y‖ < c}` up to the single point `1-c`, so a certificate for
it bounds how close to an integer the whole orbit can stay.  [Dub10] proves the case `c = 1/3`
**nonempty**, and [Dub09AA] Theorem 1 reaches only `c ≤ 1/6` (an arc of length `1/p = 1/3`), so
`c = 1/5` sits strictly between what is known possible and what is known impossible.  Closing the
endpoints kills it — `gencert.py --closed` finds no certificate to depth 60 — exactly as with
[Dub08]'s union. -/

/-! ### The `p > q²` table (thirty windows in the regime [Dub09AA] §4 leaves open)

`certFiveTwo` above is one window in this regime.  These thirty are the rest of the measured
column: at each of the five bases `(5,2)`, `(7,2)`, `(9,2)`, `(10,3)`, `(11,3)`, the window
`[i/6, i/6 + 1/p)` for `i = 0, …, 5`.  Every one certifies at funnel depth **1** — the regime is
not hard for this method, it is only out of reach of [Dub09AA]'s counting endgame, which needs
`p < q²`.  What they are *not* is the open theorem: that quantifies over all real `s`, and the
cover route to it fails (see `Z32.ZSet_five_two_fifth`). -/

/-- **[Dub08] Corollary 1.2, as printed.**  No `ξ ≠ 0` has every `{ξ(3/2)ⁿ}` inside the **closed**
set `[8/39, 18/39] ∪ [21/39, 31/39]`, of total length `20/39 = 0.5128…` — the strongest *explicit*
union-emptiness statement in the literature surveyed at plan milestone M0.  Stated for every
`ξ ≠ 0`, not just `ξ > 0`.

The closed form is genuinely stronger than its half-open shadow, and not by a notational margin:
the closed set contains the 4-cycle `6/13 → 9/13 → 7/13 → 4/13 → 6/13` of the interval map, which
runs through the right endpoint `18/39 = 6/13` and is invisible to `Ico`.  That cycle is exactly
what the certificate's rank-`0` stratum is: the funnel needs depth 3 rather than 1, the blocks are
the twelve raw components rather than four merged hulls, and they stratify into

* rank `0` — the 4-cycle `{4/13, 6/13, 7/13, 9/13}`, one outgoing edge each;
* rank `2` — the two fat blocks holding the 2-cycle `{2/5, 3/5}`, which also escape downward;
* ranks `1`, `3` — transients.

A block graph that is a partial function outright, as in the other five entries here, cannot
express that; `Z32.BlockCert.funcOk`'s rank condition can. -/

climbs further under refinement (`0.7417` at 240 cells, plan §4.4 X3), but the funnel of that
certificate is too wide to hand to `decide`; `25/36` is what the kernel checks today, against
[Dub08] Corollary 1.2's `20/39 = 0.5128…` in print.

/-- **The nearest-integer family, at `c = 1/5`.**  No `ξ ≠ 0` has every `{ξ(3/2)ⁿ}` inside
`[0, 1/5) ∪ [4/5, 1)`, a union of total length `2/5`.

The interest is not its length — `Z32.union_record_empty` certifies `25/36` — but its *shape*: the
set is `{y : ‖y‖ < 1/5}` together with the single point `4/5`, so the statement bounds how close to
an integer a whole orbit can stay.  Against it, [Dub10] exhibits `ξ` with `‖ξ(3/2)ⁿ‖ < 1/3` for
every `n`, and [Dub09AA] Theorem 1 covers arcs of length `1/p = 1/3`, i.e. `‖·‖ ≤ 1/6` only.  The
engine puts the frontier of this family between `1/5` and `0.21`: at `21/100` no certificate exists

/-! ## A second and a third base (milestone M6)

The block certificate never needed `3/2`: `Z32.not_isEventuallyPeriodic_carry` holds for every
coprime `p > q > 1`, and `Z32.BlockCert.Cert.ok` checks those conditions on the certificate's own
base, so `Cert.not_confined` applies verbatim.  These two entries are what that buys. -/

/-- **Past the [Dub09AA] line at a second base.**  `Z_{4/3}(1/3, 5/8) = ∅`: no `ξ > 0` has every
`{ξ(4/3)ⁿ}` in `[1/3, 5/8)`, a window of length `7/24 = 0.29166… > 1/4`.

`1/p = 1/4` is exactly where [Dub09AA] Theorem 1 stops at this base (it certifies every window of
length `1/p` for `1 < q < p < q²`; that general statement is `Z32.ZSet_eq_empty_of_lt_sq`, proved
in `Z32/SmallInterval.lean` by the Sturmian route).  So this is the `(4,3)` analogue of
`Z32.ZSet_three_two_sixth_3_8`, and it is the first entry of the atlas at a base other than `3/2`.

What the engine sweep behind it establishes is a **lower bound** on the `(4,3)` frontier, not the
frontier: certificates exist at every length up to `70/240 = 0.29166…` (10 positions at denominator
`240`, funnel depth `≤ 20`), and a scan of `72/240 … 94/240` found none — but that scan ran only to
depth 14, and `(4,3)` is the base where the length-`1/4` windows need depth **26**, so its silence
is not evidence.  So: at least `1.17×` the published `1/p` line here, against `1.22×`
(`0.40722` over `1/3`) at `(3,2)`. -/

/-- **An entry in the regime `p > q²`.**  `Z_{5/2}(1/5, 2/5) = ∅`: no `ξ > 0` has every
`{ξ(5/2)ⁿ}` in `[1/5, 2/5)`.

The certificate is as small as they come and can be checked by hand: the only branch whose
preimage meets `[1/5, 2/5)` is `s = 1`, giving the single survivor `[7/25, 9/25)`, which has one
outgoing edge (again `s = 1`).  So a confined orbit has the constant carry word `1, 1, 1, …`, and
`Z32.not_isEventuallyPeriodic_carry` forbids that for `ξ ≠ 0`.

**What this is and is not.**  [Dub09AA] §4 states that his Theorem 1 — emptiness at length `1/p`
for *every* real `s` — is open when `p > q²`, because the final counting step needs `p < q²`.  The
block certificate has no such step, and the engine finds every tested length-`1/p` window at
`(5,2)`, `(7,2)`, `(9,2)`, `(10,3)`, `(11,3)` certifiable.  But that is a *finite* list of rational
windows, and the natural upgrade to all real `s` — certify a cover by windows of length
`1/N + 1/p`, then apply `Z32.ZSet_mono` — **fails**: measured at `(5,2)`, `(7,2)`, `(9,2)`,
`(10,3)`, the fattened windows go FAT (hundreds to thousands of surviving components), and at
`(5,2)` with `N = 20` only `8` of the `20` cover elements certify.  So this entry is one window,
not the open theorem, and there is no tension with [Aki08] Theorems 2.4/2.5, which build *nonempty*
Cantor sets in exactly this regime.  Deciding the open statement is not something this method
reaches; see plan §11.2. -/

/-! ### The open regime as a table

[Dub09AA] §4 leaves the length-`1/p` statement open for `p > q²`, because the counting endgame of
his Theorem 1 needs `p < q²`.  `Z32.ZSet_five_two_fifth` is one window there; these five theorems
are the measured column, six positions at each of five bases, all at funnel depth 1.  They remain a
finite list of rational windows, not the open theorem — the cover route to all real `s` fails, as
recorded at `Z32.ZSet_five_two_fifth`. -/
