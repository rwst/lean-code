# Escape-parameter density (FLP95, Theorem 3.5)

Flatto–Lagarias–Pollington's Theorem 3.5 states that the *escape parameters*
`{α ∈ [0,1) : ∃ N, f_{β,α}^N(0) ≥ 1/β}` are **dense** in `[0,1)` — the input that
`FLP.SurvivorFinite.survivors_finite` needs at a dense set of `α` (`plan-FLT.html` §4.1).

This file establishes the **load-bearing keystone** of that argument: the orbit of the origin,
as a function of the offset `α`, is *piecewise affine with slope `∑_{k<n} β^k`*, the pieces being
the cylinders on which the integer parts `⌊β·f^k(0) + α⌋` are fixed.  Concretely (`phi_affine`):

> if two offsets `α, α'` induce the **same** integer-part itinerary through step `n`, then
> `f_{β,α}^n(0) − f_{β,α'}^n(0) = (∑_{k<n} β^k)·(α − α')`.

Because `∑_{k<n} β^k → ∞`, cylinders shrink like `1/∑β^k`, and the density theorem
(`escape_dense`) follows by a clean **no-tiling** contradiction: were a nonempty open interval
entirely *trapped* (`φ_n < 1/β` forever), then at the first itinerary disagreement between two of
its points there is a "crossing" where `φ_{n+1}` jumps up to arbitrarily close to `1 ≥ 1/β` — an
escape — so a trapped interval carries a single constant itinerary, forcing all its points equal by
`phi_affine`, contradicting `u < v`.  (This sidesteps the measure/cylinder-count route, which fails
for `β < 2`, the `3/2` case included.)

## Contents

* `FLP.phi` — the orbit of the origin `f_{β,α}^n(0)` as a function of `α`; `phi_succ` its one-step
  recurrence `φ_{n+1} = βφ_n + α − ⌊βφ_n + α⌋`; `phi_nonneg`, `phi_lt_one` its range `[0,1)`.
* `FLP.phi_affine` — **the keystone**: equal integer-part itineraries ⟹ the orbit difference is
  `(∑_{k<n} β^k)·(α − α')`.
* `FLP.escape_dense` — **Theorem 3.5**: for `β > 1` the escape parameters are dense (every interval
  `u < v` contains an `α` with `1/β ≤ f_{β,α}^N(0)` for some `N`).

/-- **FLP95 Theorem 3.5**: for `β > 1` the escape parameters are **dense** — every interval
`u < v` contains an `α` whose origin-orbit escapes, `1/β ≤ f_{β,α}^N(0)` for some `N`.

Proof (no measure, no cylinder tiling): if `(u,v)` were entirely trapped, a "first-disagreement
crossing" would produce an escape (`φ_{n+1}` near `1`), so `(u,v)` carries one constant itinerary,
forcing all its points equal via `phi_affine` and `∑βᵏ → ∞` — impossible for `u < v`. -/
