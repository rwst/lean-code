# The conditional capstone: M4 from the middle-band kernel

Milestone M-5 of the M4/A3 program ([M4A3] §9): the conditional capstone in the
house `hexc` pattern (mirroring `paradoxical/BakerReduction.lean`).

After Stage 2b and 2b′ (`TH.GapSlices`), what remains open of the kernel (K) is
exactly the **middle band**: (K)-violating pairs `(a, c)` whose earlier
occurrence sits *late* (`a ≥ ε′·c`) *and* whose gap grows (`c − a ≥ S`).  The
bounded-gap part (`c − a ≤ S`) and the huge-gap band (`a ≤ ε′·c`) are theorems
modulo the cited CZ 2004 axiom.  So:

* `pairRepulsion_of_middleBand` — pair repulsion at scale `θ` follows from
  finiteness of the middle band alone, by the three-way decomposition
  `kernelViolators θ ⊆ hugeGap ∪ gapBounded ∪ middleBand`.
* `superlinear_of_middleBand` — **the capstone**: the middle-band hypothesis
  (for every scale `θ` and every `ε′ > 0`, some gap threshold `S` makes the
  middle band finite) implies M4, `p_T(k)/k → ∞`.

The middle-band hypothesis `hmid` is the open Stage-2c kernel — consumed as a
named HYPOTHESIS, never an axiom, per the layered-QA policy (open conjectures
are never axiomatized).  Stage 2c ([M4A3] §6.3) attacks it: primary route the
NKR gap dichotomy (arXiv:2506.02898 Thm 1.3 + CZ 2004), fallback the
`λ_s`-as-coordinate Subspace form system.  Note the quantifier order: the
prover of `hmid` receives `ε′` (so may assume it as small as convenient) and
chooses `S` — the weakest form the decomposition supports, since 2b′ supplies
only *some* `ε′(θ) > 0`.

Axiom footprint: std3 + `Subspace.evertseSchlickewei` ([S], via the **derived**
`CZ.pseudoPisot_approx_of_subspace`, `CITED/CorvajaZannierProof.lean`; the
bespoke [CZ04] axiom was retired 2026-07-14).  With this file, the Lean side of
the program is complete modulo Stage 2c ([M4A3] §9, M-5).

/-- The **middle band** of the kernel at scale `θ`: (K)-violating pairs with
late earlier occurrence (`ε′·c ≤ a`) and gap at least `S`.  After the CZ slices
of `TH.GapSlices`, this is all that remains of (K) — the open Stage-2c target
([M4A3] §6.3). -/

/-- **The conditional capstone (M4 from the middle-band kernel)** ([M4A3] §9):
if for every rational scale `θ ∈ (0, 1)` and every `ε′ > 0` there is a gap
threshold `S` making the middle band finite, then the steering word has
superlinear subword complexity, `p_T(k)/k → ∞`.

The hypothesis is the open Stage-2c kernel, consumed in the house `hexc`
pattern (a named hypothesis, never an axiom); the bounded-gap and huge-gap
parts of (K) are discharged via the cited CZ 2004 Main Theorem, and the
reduction to (K) is the std3 Stage-1 pigeonhole.  Footprint std3 + [CZ04]. -/
