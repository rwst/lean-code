# The depth-one certificate schema, in closed form (plan z32-transform, milestone M1)

Gate G-1 of `plans/plan-z32-transform.html` asked whether the thirty kernel-checked block
certificates of [Ste26] Table 3 — six positions at each of five bases with `p > q²` — collapse
into finitely many symbolic schemas.  They collapse into **one**, and it does not need the
certificate machinery at all: this file is the anti-unified statement, proved directly.

## The schema

Fix coprime `p > q > 1` and a real position `s`, and let the window be `[s, s + 1/p)`.  Put

* `θ = (p − q)s`, `k = ⌊θ⌋`, `ε = {θ}` (`Z32.schemaTheta`, `Z32.schemaBase`, `Z32.schemaEps`).

In the coordinate `uₙ = {ξ(p/q)ⁿ − s}` the dynamics is `q·u_{n+1} = p·uₙ + θ − sₙ`, so confinement
`0 ≤ uₙ < 1/p` squeezes each carry into `(θ − q/p, θ + 1)`, an interval of length `1 + q/p < 2`:
`sₙ ∈ {k, k+1}` (`Z32.carry_eq_base_or_succ` — the alphabet lemma of [Dub09AA] Thm. 3, restated
around `⌊θ⌋` instead of `⌈θ − q/p⌉`).  The two letters are then confined to two blocks

* `sₙ = k` forces `uₙ ∈ B_low = [0, (q − pε)/p²)` (`Z32.base_block`),
* `sₙ = k+1` forces `uₙ ∈ B_high = [(1 − ε)/p, 1/p)` (`Z32.succ_block`),

and each block maps *onto* an end of the window, the two images meeting at the single point `ε/q`.
Everything therefore turns on where that one point sits relative to the hole between the blocks:

* `ε = 0` kills `B_high`, so the carry word is constantly `k`;
* `q ≤ pε` kills `B_low`, so it is constantly `k+1`;
* `q² ≤ p(p+q)ε` and `(p+q)ε ≤ q` make each letter forbid its own repetition, so the word
  alternates.

In all three cases the carry word is eventually periodic, which [DN05] Lemma 2
(`Z32.not_isEventuallyPeriodic_carry`) forbids for `ξ ≠ 0`.  That is the whole proof: no interval
arithmetic, no certificate structure, and nothing for the kernel to evaluate.  (`decide` does
appear below, but only to discharge `Nat.Coprime p q` at numeral bases — never on certificate
data.)

## Main results

* `Z32.SchemaCertified` — the hypothesis on `ε`, the union of the three cases above.
* `Z32.not_confined_of_certified` — the core: a certified window traps no orbit.
* `Z32.exists_fract_ge_of_certified` — the [Dub09AA]-style "infinitely often" form.
* `Z32.ZSet_eq_empty_of_certified` — `Z_{p/q}(s, s + 1/p) = ∅`, for every **real** certified `s`
  and with no assumption on the arithmetic nature of `ξ`.
* `Z32.ZSet_zero_eq_empty` — target T1: the plan's schema `𝒮₀`, at every coprime base.
* `Z32.ZSet_half_eq_empty` — the gate's own test position `s = 1/2`.
* `Z32.ZSet_five_two`, `Z32.ZSet_seven_two`, `Z32.ZSet_nine_two`, `Z32.ZSet_ten_three`,
  `Z32.ZSet_eleven_three` — target T2: [Ste26] Theorem `thm:pastsquare`, six positions at each of
  five bases, now a corollary of one symbolic statement instead of thirty kernel checks.
* `Z32.ZSet_five_two_interval`, `Z32.ZSet_five_two_upper` — target T3 grade 1: emptiness for a
  continuum of real positions at a base with `p > q²`.

## Scope, honestly

For `p < q²` the emptiness itself is [Dub09AA] Theorem 1, already in the corpus as
`Z32.ZSet_eq_empty_of_lt_sq`; what is new there is only which windows are *depth one*.  For
`p > q²` [Dub19] Theorem 1.1 settles every position for **algebraic** `ξ`, so the statements here
are new only for transcendental `ξ` — and every use must say "with no assumption on the arithmetic
nature of `ξ`".  The residual positions, where this file says nothing, are exactly two `ε`-bands of
total measure `2q²/(p(p+q))`; see `plans/note-z32transform-G1.html` §5.
