# The regularity lemma: `2/3` is a regular point (plan-B1E2, WP10, T2)

**If `σ(·,0)` is a permutation of the kernel, then `2/3` and every `(2/3)^{k^m}` is a *regular*
point of the Mahler system** — `det M` does not vanish there (`regular_two_thirds`).

Unconditional, elementary, and of independent interest: [AF17] stress that *no* condition in the
literature rules out the exceptional branch of their Cor 1.8, and this is a checkable sufficient
condition at rational points.

## The lever

The whole proof is three lines of mathematics, and it turns on our point being **rational**:

1. `M(0) = P₀` (`RB.mahlerMatrix_map_eval_zero`), so if `σ(·,0)` is a permutation then `M(0)` is
   a permutation matrix and **`det M(0) = ±1`** (`det_eval_zero_eq_pm_one`).
2. `det M ∈ ℤ[z]`, so `det M(0) = ±1` *is* its constant coefficient.
3. **Rational-root theorem**: a rational root of an integer polynomial has numerator dividing the
   constant coefficient. Dividing `±1` forces numerator `±1`. But `(2/3)^N = 2^N/3^N` has
   numerator `2^N ≥ 2` for `N ≥ 1`. ∎ (`not_root_of_coeff_zero_pm_one`)

Since `k^m ≥ 1` for every `m ≥ 0` whenever `k ≥ 1`, **all** the iterates `(2/3)^{k^m}` are covered
at once — including `m = 0`, i.e. `2/3` itself.

## Where the lever stops — and why that is coherent

The rational-root theorem says **nothing** at algebraic irrationals, and [AF17] §8.1's
counterexample to any regularity-free transcendence claim lives exactly there: its singular points
are `φ = (1−√5)/2` and its `3ˡ`-th roots. That the lever works precisely where the counterexample
does not is a good sign — but note the corollary: **plan-B1E2's E.2 cases, whose evaluation point
`1/σβ` is an algebraic irrational, do not inherit it** ([B1E2] §5). Case 2 of E.2 needs a genuine
regularity argument at algebraic points, which nobody has.

## Status of the debt this discharges

Rev. 1 of [B1E2] filed regularity as "known technical debt … one hard sub-lemma". Gate 0 showed
it was the *whole* difference between Track I working and not. It is now a theorem in the main
case, and an exhaustive search (all systems with `k ∈ {2,3}`, `d ∈ {2,3,4}`, `m < 4`) found
**zero** genuine singularities at `(2/3)^{k^m}`: 39130 systems have `det M((2/3)^{k^m}) = 0`, but
every one of them has `det M ≡ 0` — degenerate, every point singular, `2/3` not special — and
none has `det P₀ ≠ 0`, confirming the lever. **So Track I is blocked on exactly one input: the
`p`-adic port (WP5), which does not exist in the literature.** Regularity is *not* the blocker.

## Contents

* **`RB.not_root_of_coeff_zero_pm_one`** — the arithmetic core: an integer polynomial with
  constant coefficient `±1` has no root `(2/3)^N`, `N ≥ 1`.
* **`RB.det_eval_zero_eq_pm_one`** — `σ(·,0)` a permutation ⇒ `det M(0) = ±1`.
* **`RB.regular_two_thirds`** — the regularity lemma (T2).

/-- **The lever's hypothesis, discharged** ([B1E2] §0.2(2)+(4)): if `σ(·,0)` is a permutation of
the index set, then `M(0)` is its permutation matrix, so `det M(0) = sign = ±1`.

(The plan reaches this via the permutation expansion of `det M` — §0.2(3), "the all-zeros tuple
contributes `z⁰` with coefficient `±1`".  Going through `M(0) = P₀` is the same fact and is
shorter in Lean, so the expansion is not formalized separately.) -/

/-! ## The regularity lemma -/

/-- **T2 — the regularity lemma** ([B1E2] §0.2): if `σ(·,0)` is a permutation of the index set,
then **`2/3` is a regular point**: `det M` vanishes at none of the iterates `(2/3)^{k^m}`.

All iterates are covered at once, `m = 0` (i.e. `2/3` itself) included, because `k^m ≥ 1`.

Unconditional and elementary. It works *because* the point is rational; see the module doc for
where it stops. -/
